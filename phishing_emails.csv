12,"begin forwarded text Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2002 13:57:15 -0400 To: Digital Bearer Settlement List From: ""R. A. Hettinga"" Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender: http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jspPosted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulationBy Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology ColumnistThe facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices.And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.''How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources.If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market.We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential.But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both.The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough.The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether.Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly.It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year.-- ----------------- R. A.

support for legislation that will be center-stage in the next session.
This is an opportunity to ask your representative to take a stand for
your rights. Ask her/him to co-sponsor the DMCRA today!Representatives Rick Boucher and John Doolittle recently introduced
the Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act (DMCRA, H.R. 5544), which
would require labelling on usage-impaired ""copy-protected"" compact
discs and would make several several amendments to 1998's infamous
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).Take action here:

2002"" (S. 2395, also known as ""the Biden Bill""). It started as an
attempt to stop organized crime from forging holograms and
counterfeiting money, but its scope has been greatly expanded to
include digital watermarks on copyrighted material. This is a sneaky
power-grab that would greatly diminish the rights of the public in
copyrighted works while expanding the power of copyright owners. It
goes well beyond the scope of current copyright law and could:~ Prevent universities, libraries, and consumers from enjoying the
exceptions to the Copyright Act adopted by Congress. S. 2935 could
prohibit the use of interface information essential for software
interoperability and competition~ Impose new responsibilities on Internet service providers and could
also require consumer electronics and computer manufacturers to
reconfigure their products.~ Impose more severe criminal and civil penalties than permitted by
the Copyright Act for identical behaviorThis ""anticounterfeiting"" bill is a decoy; stand up for your rights
today! Subscribe to the EFF Action Center and send your member of
Congress an email, letter or fax. You can take action by going to:http://action.eff.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=2274Join EFF! For membership information see:
http://www.eff.org/support/-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------* Canadian Trademark Law OverreachingEFF has been involved in several cases involving overreaching
trademark claims on the Internet. Recently we have learned about a
Canadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal
information website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem
especially egregious.Lawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been
published since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued
by Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group.
Quicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name
LAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website
under that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of
the Quicklaw.com website that offers public ""teasers"" in the form of
summaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available
through the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian
lawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially
different, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed
computer service and the other for information freely available on the
public internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more
problematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the
term LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed
requests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark
authorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a
Canadian trademark issued for ""lawsnet.""Regardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia
through over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a
court order requiring her to undergo an extensive ""discovery"" process
that threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free
legal assistance in the past, this next phase will require
significantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can
muster. Quicklaw is represented by a large Toronto firm, Borden Ladner
and Gervais, LLP.Abuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even
been granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is
unfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw,
and its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and
useful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark
is causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant
ownership in words, especially descriptive words like ""laws"" and ""net""
when describing an online legal information service. Trademark law
should also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal
information (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop
individuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free
legal information to the public.For those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local Toronto lawyer and
part-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a
legal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help,

30,"sle 31 call for papers , sle 31 , st andrews , scotland , 26-30 august 1998 workshop on modality in generative grammar the description and analysis of modality is of central interest to the study of human language . modality interacts with many subsystems of syntax and a better understanding of modality would further our understanding of these subsystems greatly . the relevant subsystems play a role in the existing analyses of the epistemic-deontic dichotomy . this has been attributed to : ( i ) argument structure ( e . g . ross 1969 ) : epistemic modals are one-place predicates ( corresponding to raising verbs syntactically ) , whereas deontic modals are two-place predicates ( corresponding to control verbs syntactically ) . ( ii ) insertion position : epistemic modals are generated in i , deontic modals in v ( e . g . picallo 1990 ) . ( iii ) lf position : epistemic modals are in c , deontic modals in vp ( e . g . mcdowell 1987 ) . ( iv ) nature of the complement of a modal : a definite verbal complement with epistemic modals and an indefinite verbal complement with deontic modals ( e . g . barbiers 1995 ) . v ) pragmatics : the dichotomy is contextually determined and does not correspond to a syntactic difference ( kratzer 1989 ) . many questions still need to be answered before a sufficiently adequate analysis can be developed . as for argument structure , it should be asked what evidence we have that each modal has two different argument structures . if such evidence exists , are these argument structures represented in the lexicon , as in theta-theoretic accounts , or only syntactically ? related questions concern the categorial status of modals ( a special category aux in english , but main verbs in german and dutch ) , the selectional restrictions they impose on their complement ( semantically uniform , but not syntactically : only verbal complements in english , no categorial restrictions in dutch , verbal and certain prepositional complements in german and afrikaans ) . as for their syntactic position at surface structure or lf , we need to know more about the ( scopal ) interaction of modals with negation . it is clear that there is a tight connection between modality and negation / affirmation : many languages have a modal that behaves as an negative polarity item ( english ` need ' , german ` brauchen ' , dutch ` hoeven ' ) . a related issue is the interaction of modals with focus particles , especially those that have a negative or affirmative import , such as english ` only ' or french ` bien ' . it seems that such focus particles can alter the syntactic and semantic behaviour of modals . the ( scopal ) interaction of modals with other quantifiers and modals with question operators is also in need of a better description and analysis . it has been claimed that question formation and epistemic modality exclude each other . although this does not seem to hold in general , question formation and epistemic modality do seem to restrict each other in ways that are poorly understood . the interaction of modal verbs with modal adverbials is also relevant for the determination of the syntactic position of modals , particulary in view of cinque 's ( 1997 ) hypothesis that every sentence contains two modal projections that must be either filled by a modal adverbial in the specifier or by a modal verb in the head . many languages have a construction with ` have to ' or ` be to ' that involves a modal interpretation . such constructions do not generally have an epistemic interpretation ( but consider english ` he was never to see her again ' , dutch ` het is te verwachten dat . . . ' ` it is to be expected that . . . ' ) . there are a great many cross-linguistic peculiarities on this point , which are worth exploring . for example , one question is how this type of construction , lacking a visible modal element , yields a modal interpretation . there is a more general question concerning modality : which properties of modals are necessary for modality and which are accidental ? cross - linguistically , modals often have a irregular present tense inflection paradigm . it is unclear whether this is a necessary property of modals and if so , why . the fact that english modals are auxilaries but modals in other languages are not is presumably an accidental property , and so is the fact that english modals lack infinitives and participles in their paradigm , whereas dutch modals do have infinitival and participial forms ( except for the verb ` zullen ' ` will ' ) . as it seems that the bulk of generative studies of modality involves germanic languages , we particularly invite papers on modality in romance and central european languages . organizers : sjef barbiers ( leiden ) , frits beukema ( leiden ) , olga tomic ( novi sad ) , milena milojevic sheppard ( ljubljana ) , marija golden ( ljubljana ) . please submit abstract ( 1 a4 max ) to : professor olga miseska tomic bulevar avnoja 109 / iii , stan 16 beograd yu 11070 yugoslavija e - mail : efilb01 @ yubgss21 . bg . ac . yu & dr sjef barbiers hil / department of dutch studies p . n . van eyckhof 3 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : barbiers @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl & dr frits beukema hil / department of english p . n . van eyckhof 4 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : beukema @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl closing date for submission of abstract : 15 may 1998 date of acceptance / rejection of abstract : 1 july 1998",Safe Email

33,"release of agfl home page this message announces the release of the world wide web home page of agfl ( affix grammars over a finite lattice ) . 1 . agfl the agfl formalism , developed at the university of nijmegen , the netherlands , is a formalism in which context free grammars can be described compactly . agfls are two level grammars : a first , context free level is augmented with features for expressing agreement between parts of speech . features are treated as types , and their values may range over the subsets of a given finite set , which explains the acronym affix grammars over a finite lattice . agfl grammars are transformed into a parser by the parser generator opt . the generated parser is a recursive backup parser which computes the values of the affixes on the fly . in this way , fast and efficient parsers can be generated . the formalism is quite simple and limited , and therefore easy to read and write . agfl comes with a grammar workbench gwb , supporting the development of grammars and the checking of their consistency . the agfl formalism does not require any special hardware . the parser generator opt runs on regular sparc - systems and ms-dos machines ( 386 or higher ) and is relatively small . for instance , the ms-dos version requires less than 1 mb harddisk space . 2 . agfl on the web agfl has now been made available to the ( computational ) linguistic community . we think it can be used by ( computational ) linguists who are in need of a simple grammar formalism with a fast parser generator , suitable for experimental purposes . therefore , we have made agfl available via ftp and , recently , via www . the agfl home page contains information about the agfl formalism like the agfl manual , documentation and papers , sample grammars and the latest developments . there is also the possibility to download the software and to register yourself as an agfl user . you are invited to take a look at the home page and to read the information or to download the software . please feel free to make use of agfl and its home page ; we look forward to hear about your experiences . we are currently planning an agfl workshop in june . the latest news about this workshop can also be found on the agfl home page . the url of the agfl home page is : http : / / www . cs . kun . nl / agfl / the address of the ftp - site is : ftp : / / hades . cs . kun . nl / pub / agfl / the organisation of the www page should be self-explanatory . the structure of the ftp - site is as follows : - readme - doc : this directory contains a number of relevant papers - pc386 : this directory contains software for ms-dos machines and an installation guide . - sun4 : this directory contains software for sparc - stations and an installation guide . any questions or remarks with respect to agfl or the agfl home page can be sent to : www-agfl @ cs . kun . nl . on behalf of the agfl team , erik oltmans department of computer science university of nijmegen the netherlands",Safe Email

38,"Thanks Brent: now it's clearer (to me) what's needed. I've used the global

If I have an instance of exmh running, the folder I'm visiting will have
its new, correct .xmhcache overwritten with an incorrect one when I switch

39,"re : 6 . 381 words that are their own opposites several people submitted "" overlook "" and "" oversight "" , which are fine examples of this phenomenon in english ( though i think that mary neff 's "" outgoing : retiring "" is perhaps the most elegant submission to date . ) perhaps my current work on the various shades of meaning in english prepositions has biased me , but in any case i think that the difference in the various senses of "" oversight "" and "" overlook "" stems largely from their compounding with "" over - "" . "" over "" is sneaky ; at first glance it seems to be fairly limited in expressive power , but deeper analysis reveals that in it lurk a number of distinctions of meaning , some of them quite subtle indeed . in addition to nuances of physical location , "" over "" can indicate power relationships ( both outright force , and more subtle authority ) , value judgements , and the general notion of ( metaphorically ) moving on to another thing , as in "" get over it "" and "" skip over "" . so my analysis of "" oversight "" and "" overlook "" would be that in one sense , "" over "" takes on the meaning of authority-over , and in the other sense it takes on the meaning of skipping-over . perhaps a similar argument could be make for the "" sight / see / look "" part of the compound ? for instance , useages such as "" see to it "" "" look to your own interest "" seem to carry some of this "" authority "" meaning . i think the "" over "" analysis is more clear-cut , but it would be interesting to see if someone will make a case for the other half . - - marion kee marion kee | all opinions are my own ; knowledge engineer , center for machine translation | when cmu wants my opinions carnegie mellon university pittsburgh , pa , usa | it pays for them .",Safe Email

difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
headers that my mail reader added:class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):    skip = {'received': 1,
            'date': 1,
            'x-from_': 1,
            }    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
        for k, v in msg.items():
            k = k.lower()
            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                continue
            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                for t in tokenize_word(w):
                    yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t)This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer.It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
start with stuff like:> Dear Sir/Madam,
> 
> May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a

64,"closing linguistics at soas call for help ! ! ! soas department of phonetics and linguistics to be closed in october 1992 dear colleagues , on tuesday may 19 , dr david bennett , head of our department , was told that we would cease functioning as of october of this year . we are a department of the school of oriental and african studies of the university of london . the members of our department are : dr david bennett prof thea bynon dr wynn chao dr monik charette dr katrina hayward dr richard hayward * dr george hewitt * * dr bruce ingham prof jonathan kaye prof ruth kempson * cross appointed with the africa department * * cross appointed with the near and middle east department our department offers degrees at the ba , ma , mphil and phd level . approximately 60 students , mostly at the postgraduate level are enrolled . many other students , particularly from university college , london ( ucl ) take courses with us . we run an ma - linguistics and an ma - phonetics programme jointly with ucl . we also have an ma in english - arabic applied linguistics and translation together with birbeck college . all these programmes will of course be affected by this decision . the department of phonetics and linguistics is the oldest linguistic department in the u . k . it was the home of the "" london school "" which received worldwide attention under the intellectual leadership of prof jr firth . his chair , which i occupy today , was the first chair of linguistics in the u . k . over the years our graduates have distinguished themselves in many areas of linguistics . later postings will provide a partial list of the more well known soas graduates . it is acknowledged , even by the administration of soas , that we remain a centre of academic excellence in our field . the decision to close the soas linguistics department was made with no consultation , no advanced warning . it was a result of discussions by the governing body of the school , the finance and general purposes committee and the management committee . there is no linguistic representation on any of these bodies . the reasons given for closing the department are : ( 1 ) severe budget cuts ( 2 ) our low number of undergraduate students ( 3 ) the "" general perception "" that our department is not well integrated into the school . it was stated that , among the options considered closing our department would cause the "" least harm "" to the school . no one was present to represent the linguistics side of the story . this decision will be presented to the academic board of the school on wednesday may 27 . the academic board has an advisory role only but we are hoping to mobilise school opinion against this decision . unlike similar cases in other countries , most of the members of our department will not be redeployed elsewhere in the school . recent legislation has virtually destroyed the notion of tenure in the u . k . many of us are facing "" premature retirement "" , "" redundancy "" or some form of "" severance "" agreement . the administration of the school seems to feel that we will easily find jobs and that terminating our employment at the school will cause us no undue hardships . given the administration 's figures for the cost of severing their relation with us , the offers that we are likely to receive from the school will not be very attractive . as of now , no statement has been forthcoming about our future at the school but the director has stated that he will be meeting with us individually next week . we will keep you posted on this aspect . if you would like to do something to try and help us stop the closing of our department , please send ( in order of preference ) a fax or a letter to me at the address and fax number given below . if possible use your institution 's letterhead . please feel free to make comments about our department as a whole or about individual members with whose work or reputation you are familiar . pass this message along to your colleagues and encourage them to write as well . if you feel so inclined , departmental resolutions reflecting your opinion of this event would be quite helpful . i hope to be able to arrive at next wednesday 's meeting with an armful of your letters ( copies of all letters will be sent to our director ) and your support will do a lot to improve our spirits . this will be a long and difficult struggle both for our department and for our jobs and careers . thank you in advance for listening and for your support . jonathan kaye professor of general linguistics department of phonetics & linguistics school of oriental and african studies thornhaugh street , russell square london , wc1h 0xg u . k . e-mail : jk @ ukacrl . earn jk @ uk . ac . rl . ib ( janet ) fax number : ( 44 ) + 71-436 - 3844",Safe Email

71,"Looks and sounds a hell of a lot like Clare's cat, Violence...A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?
http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.html
Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat
The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a 
sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in 
Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley 
in just four weeks.Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside 
the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security 
cameras captured it on film.The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and 
two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.He said: ""It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of 
a hunter.""It looked at me calmly before moving on.""The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had 
been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news 
of the sighting.His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images 
of the large cat prowling through their garden.She said: ""I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate 
for it to get hurt.""Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their 
usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden but barked 
that morning.He warned: ""I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they 
might jump you.""Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead 
Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.12:27 Tuesday 8th October 2002_________________________________________________________________

75,"re : 5 . 1237 sum : basic word order ( and remarks on typology ) fritz newmeyer raises some important issues about typological research as instantiated in nichols ' work and elsewhere , which call for some comments . first , the notion of language type is an idealization : this is often made clear in typology courses , where non-existent artificial languages are considered as logically possible or impossible language types , if not always in the published literature ( though the point is clearly made in comrie 's textbook , for example , by the discussion of morphological typology ) . similarly , fritz is quite right to point out that the assumption of no areal or genetic bias , to the extent that it is made at all , is a counterfactual one . what i would ask is whether such idealizations differ in kind from those , many of them counterfactual , which underlie generative grammar . the justification is similar in both cases : methodologically , one cannot deal with all the relevant variables all the time , and some of the concepts used are logically independent of the extrinsic variables , e . g . one can investigate consistency with proposed implicational universals regardless of the statistical bias in one 's sample . the term ` shaky typological pigeon-holing ' is particularly inapt as applied to nichols ' distinction between head-marking and dependent - marking languages , which is quite explicitly a matter of degree ( see her 1986 paper where the degree of hm vs . dm is quantifified in terms of the number of patterns instantiating each type ) . if nichols refers to a ` head-marking language ' this is shorthand for a quantifiable tendency , just as we might describe italian as a ` pro-drop language ' without implying that there is a binary distinction here ( in fact there are degrees of pro-drop , e . g . some languages allow null expletives but not null referential subjects , etc ) . another point which i think all typologists would accept is that languages which do n't appear to match an established type are typological data - for example , colloquial french as discussed recently on linguist is a language which might reasonably be described as having no basic word order ( i believe that nichols classified it as vso in one of her tables , but that is again shorthand for a more complex situation ) . this is an explanandum for which nichols ' 1986 paper offers an explanation : head-marking facilitates word order freedom , and colloquial french instantiates clausal head-marking in nichols ' sense . to sum up : pace widespread opinion , typologists ' goal is not pigeon-holing ( "" taxonomy "" is also widely used in this context ! ) but the investigation and explanation of patterns of variation . steve matthews",Safe Email

Some interesting quotes...http://www.postfun.com/pfp/worbois.html
Thomas Jefferson:""I have examined all the known superstitions of the word, and I do not
find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature.
They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent
men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been
burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this
coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites;
to support roguery and error all over the earth.""SIX HISTORIC AMERICANS,

Is there a relatively clean way to dynamically build comp files based on
the path of the current folder?  Yeah, I know exmh will pull the first comp in the path up from the
  current folder to the mail root, but that's not what I want.I'm starting to use plus addressing heavily as part of my SPAM controls.
Specifically I each mailing list with a list-specific address.  eg I would subscribe to this list as claw+exmh@kanga.nu or perhaps
  claw+exmh-users@kanga.nu instead of claw@kanga.nuHowever to do this I need a new set of comp files for each list folder.
As I'm subscribed to something just over 600 lists, that's rather a
pain.  I really don't want to go create and maintain ~1,800 comp files
(components, replcomps, replgroupcomps), especially not as I suspect
I'll be changing or adapting my naming pattern a few times as I adapt
various supporting tools.What would be great is if I could build the relevant comp file
dynamically at runtime.  That way I don't need to maintain a couple
thousand comp files, I just need to make my plus addresses
predictable/computable based (say) on the folder path.  eg I'm currently in folder:    +-Lists-/Products/Exmh-L    The script would dynamically build a compfile which had a From: of
    claw+exmh@kanga.nu for repl, comp, etc.  Similarly when in folder:    +-Lists-/Linux/SVLUG-L  I'd get a From: of claw+svlug@kanga.nuThat way I can use lookup tables for those folders which have multiple
lists being delivered into them.Any ideas how this might be done in an automatic/maintainable fashion?
It would be more than good enough if all I had to do was drop a tiny
FROM_HEADER file in each folder that somehow got picked up by the comp
file...--

This is remarkable for its lack of newsworthiness.1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed. You can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g. http://www.picotech.com/applications/colossus.html2) For decades before that, codebreakers were using optical computing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns. You can read about it in Kahn.3) People have been doing opto-electronic computing for decades. There's a lot more to it than just holography.

bytecodes.  That font is ""QuickType II"", grabbed off my Windows

Date: Not suppliedA San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding 
class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my 
(non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco? 
    In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you 
    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, 
    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request...     So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? 
    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a 
    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an 
    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to 
    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as 
    disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor 
    drivers can't unionize.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via CamWorld[3]_)[1] http://www.bradnewsham.com/articles/why_so_hard.shtml

 Dear readers,The majority of PC users may run Windows, but Microsoft can't
touch the passion that Mac users bring to computing. This week,
Apple devotees gathered in New York to find out what their guru,
Steve Jobs, has in store for them. They were not disappointed,
with offerings ranging from the new iMacs, which continue to push
the boundaries of the PC form factor, to updated iPods that
include more memory, better menus, and compatibility with
Windows. Read the

Whatever happened to the straightforward, dedicated PIM?
   PIM/contact managers, such as the ubiquitous Outlook and
   Lotus, pushed them to the sidelines. But a few PIMs survived
   this enforced obscurity. If you need a plain PIM that doesn't
   cost a fortune, one of these may tickle your fancy.

Gene Kan:   Gnutella open-source guru Gene Kan, who died on June
   29 in an apparent suicide, was clearly beloved by the CNET
   community. Last week, search requests for information on
   25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on
   products and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the
   peer-to-peer space, many credit him with legitimizing file
   sharing--making it about more than music, according to Wired

Macworld:   The annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a
   good show, whether or not Steve Jobs has anything real to
   announce. So far, it looks like Apple has already surprised a
   few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No. 7),
   which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing
   quagmire.

PayPal:
   
   It's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and
   PayPal deal. Soon after eBay announced it was buying PayPal
   for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a lawsuit claiming that
   PayPal's price tag was too low. This week, PayPal is being
   subpoenaed by the New York attorney general in regard to its
   involvement with online gambling transactions.

Wi-Fi:   I'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up
   on the Buzz Meter permanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting
   interest because of a possible pact between tech heavyweights,
   including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon Communications, to
   build wireless access places across the nation in public areas
   where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as
   airports.

eMac:   This is the for-education-only computer that consumers
   wanted so badly that Apple released it to them. The CNET
   review is out, and here's the word: the eMac is what the iMac
   used to be. Basically, it's an easy-to-use, fairly inexpensive
   computer for users who don't need to do much besides word
   processing and accessing the Web.

it affects performance, and 2) when those troops go to a real desert

Float:Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  5 MillionInsider & Institutional Holdings:92% SharesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â "" CXIN MEDIA CORPORATION, THE BLOOMBERG OF CHINA."" - Finance and Investment Magazine, December 2001Ã‚Â THE COMPANY:CXIN Media Corporation is an integrated media company focusing on the dissemination and aggregation of information. Currently, CXINs core business is in the publishing and aggregation of Financial, Economic, and Business Information on the Peoples Republic of China. The value CXIN Media provides is its ability to source, package, and present information that is highly in demand by the market.Apart from the core print and electronic publishing business, CXIN is involved in other related businesses, such as organizing and managing events such as conferences, seminars, and training in the field of wealth management and personal finance.These areas are closely linked to the core competencies of the company and they intend to leverage on the brands that they have built to further drive the growth potential.CXIN holds the key to success in the Peoples Republic of China. In May of 2001 they acquired the 12 year exclusive right from the China Economic Information Network, a corporation under the direct management of the State Information Center and the State Planning Development Commission, Chinas highest economic decision body.HIGHLIGHTS:May 2001, CXIN acquires the 12 year Exclusive license to distribute all information in English, French and Spanish, Internationally.February 2002, CXIN announced its first distribution contract with a leading market research provider.March 2002, CXIN announces it had signed with yet another distributor for its unique financial , economic and business information on the Peoples Republic of China.Ã‚Â May 7, 2002, CXIN announces a distribution agreement with Internet Securities, a Euromarket company and the leading provider of emerging market securities.May 9, 2002, CXIN announces it had hired one of Asias top media consulting firms, Telesis, and its President, Mr. Cyril Pereira, the former Director of Operation of the South China Morning Post and Asia Magazine.June 12, 2002, CXIN launched its China Business portal and began selling subscriptions.June 24, 2002, CXIN announces the acquisition ofÃ‚Â  Smart Investor Magazine and related business. This magazine will bring over $1.2 Million in consolidated revenues.Ã‚Â July 15, 2002, CXIN announces the license agreement with Lexis-Nexis, one of the worlds largest aggregators.INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS:According to the reports from Morgan-Stanley, which analyzes the worlds superpowers in 11 industries, it only takes 8 years to build a media empire, which means the return on investment in this industry will be far greater than that of pharmaceutical, household merchandise, energy, or even banking. We believe that CXIN Media is well positioned to become the next superpower of the media market in the fast growing Chinese market. The superior management and its exclusive agreement granted by the Chinese government provide the company with an ""unfair advantage"" over its potential competitors. We believe that the recent license agreements signed with some of the largest information providers in the world as well as the Smart Investor Magazines and related business will enable the company to meet its revenue and profit expectation of $50 Million within the next 5 years and dependent on market condition for refinancing, we foresee that CXIN Media could easily double their expected revenue and profits through strategic acquisitions. The current price of the shares do not reflect the value of this growth company, in comparison to the sector CXIN Media should be currently trading between $0.25 to $0.50 and above this value when we take into consideration the growth factors.Disclaimer: The Wall Street Weekly provides information on selected companies that it believes has investment potential.

158,"Dear Sir, 
With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you
would
be of great assistance to my children and I.
I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that
you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me
or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the
KEREMA
local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.
MUNDI A.
KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul
Koromah
because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining
Corporation
of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
instructed me
and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,
before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)
forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
and I
managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came
into
Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE
MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited
with a
Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the
currier
company who will freight the money to your country.
Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
your
country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
future of
my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
Trust
Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be
deposited
into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to
source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.
We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I
am being
monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice
you to
have the 
deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this
email:
ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us
proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring
same into
your account.
Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private
discussions. 
Note: There is no risk involved in this business. 
Remain Blessed,

168,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,781616,00.htmlBritons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in EuropeJohn Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The GuardianNot every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

176,"Here's a weird and wacky problem:I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I 
tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved 
pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd 
used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I 
was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having 
somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows 
and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. 
Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. 
Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where 
there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up 
and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection 
of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel 
that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?Cheers,

the module.  There are three ways to open db files with bsddb (btopen,

the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""
Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the
French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.""The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""
Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.""This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.Barbara ""ears of corn"" MikkelsonLast updated:   29 July 2002http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email

- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.Ã‚Â  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""Ã‚Â  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.Ã‚Â  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!Ã‚Â  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.Ã‚Â  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.Ã‚Â I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! Here is the bottom line ...I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.Ã‚Â  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!Ã‚Â  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.Ã‚Â  This is my
pledge to you.BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!Ã‚Â  To order Extreme Power Plus on our secure server, just click

Forwarded by: Gary Williams A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till 
the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
""Extra Long, King Size"".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"".  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: ""Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways."" Mom fainted.

By Denis MuellerAt the end of World War II, the United States was a rigidly 
segregated country but there were cracks beginning to show. 
In 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that ruled that segregated 
seating on interstate transportation was illegal. In 1947, 
the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) decided to challenge 
the racist system. The opposition was fierce and the riders 
were jailed often ending up on chain gangs.By 1961, the time was right to challenge America's Jim Crow 
laws and CORE proposed the ""Freedom Rides."" CORE felt that 
they could count on the racists to oppose the rides thereby 
creating a crisis that would force the Federal Government to 
intervene to enforce the law. It would be dangerous and CORE 
members knew that they were risking their lives, but as CORE 
director James Farmer maintained they were ready.  ""When we 
began the ride I think all of us were prepared for as much 
violence as could be thrown at us. We were prepared for the 
possibility of death.""

south they met no resistance but by the time they got to 
Alabama they were met by an angry band of terrorists who 
slashed the tires and burned the bus. In Birmingham it was 
worse. The FBI, through its informant James Rowe, were well 
aware that the Ku Klux Klan was waiting for them. So were 
the Birmingham police, led by Chief of police Bull Conner, 
and when they arrived they were severely beaten. Despite the warnings there were no police to protect them. 
Governor Patterson showed no mercy and blamed the riders. 
So the terrorist attacks went on. The ""Freedom Riders"" were 
determined to continue and were joined by a group of Nash-
ville students. They were met by hostility and were arrested 
and sent back to Tennessee. But the riders were fearless and 
immediately returned to Birmingham ready to continue the 
journey.------------------------------------------------------------    ---------> The Paranormal Insider Is Here! <---------ShagMail is PROUD to introduce our one and only paranormal

""Freedom Riders"" left Birmingham on May 20th determined to 
continue. State officials had promised Attorney General Robert 
Kennedy they would be protected, but by the time they reached 
Montgomery there were no state police in sight. Seeing a mob, 
the riders feared for their lives, but Jim Zwerg, a white man, 
bravely walked out of the bus and was nearly beaten to death. 
He still suffers from the effects but his courage was un-
deniable. Others including Justice Department official John 
Seigenthaler were also beaten.The situation seemed to be out of control and federal inter-
vention finally saved the day with Governor Patterson declar-
ing martial law. Robert Kennedy called for a cooling off 
period but the riders refused. They would continue on. So 
they set off to Jackson, Mississippi but  Kennedy had made a 
deal with Mississippi officials. They were supposed to be 
protected, but upon arriving they were arrested. Kennedy had 
caved in. It was a cowardly decision by the Attorney General 
and the riders were sentenced for 60 days for exercising 
their constitutional rights. They never finished their trip 
but their courage showed the power of civil disobedience and 
in the end justice would prevail and terrorism would be 
defeated. It is another example of how people change things, 
not government officials.Sources: Eyes on the Prize------------------------------------------------------------

 Try installing the latest Perl (at least 5.6.1) port on Freebsd and make
sure you set the system to use perl from ports (i.e. in the
ports/lang/perl5/files directory run ./use.perl port. Reinstall the relevant
perl modules needed by razor and try again.Sven-------------------------------------------------------

272,"Uh, WWII Enigma was cracked at Bletchly Park, based on the work of some 
Poles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded.   
Entirely mechanical!   Definitely not optical at all.    Enigma was 
originally broken based on bad use practice.  If it had been employed more 
sensibly it would have been a lot harder.See ""The Code Book"" by Singh, Doubleday, 1999.     Or, for that matter, 
""Cryptonomicon"" by Stephenson, which is a fictionalization of the Enigma 
cracking story, and pretty accurate.I eventually get born as a side-effect of the Battle of Britain, you 
see....Computing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but Enigma 
was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially Enigma 
machines and brute-forcing.Eirikur

I wouldn't say that the societies of humans here before European occupancy
was 'lifted' by free xyz. Perhaps 'replaced' or 'sunk' or some other
description, but not 'lifted'. Also, the lifestyle of the remnants of those

directly compared, because I changed the methodology.  In 2.40 the scores
were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie.
there was no ""blind"" testing, and the scores could overfit and still
provide good statistics.In 2.42, they're evaluated ""blind"", on a totally unseen set of messages,
so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.--j.",Safe Email

329,"amta workshop on embedded mt systems - cfp workshop announcement - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - workshop on embedded mt systems call for papers design , construction , and evaluation of systems with an mt component wednesday , october 28 , 1998 ( preceding the amta 98 conference ) sheraton bucks county hotel , langhorne , pennsylvania introduction as the strengths and weaknesses of machine translation ( mt ) engines have become better understood and accepted , there has been a marked increase in the development of computer systems with anembedded mt component . one consequence of this shift to "" embedded mt "" is that researchers , developers , as well as users have begun pushing the limits on the input that such systems will accept for translation . in so doing , a new class of problems has surfaced : any input - - - whether it appears in physical form on paper , in electronic form on-line , or mixed in with another modality such as graphics or video - - - will bring with it some unknown mix of noisy natural language data as well as non-linguistic data . how are systems with an mt component to be designed and evaluated given the challenge this input brings ? the objective of this workshop is to examine and evaluate techniques for adjusting this "" linguistic impedance mismatch "" between the real-world input and the natural language input expected by various mt engines . thus the workshop will focus on computational approaches to preprocessing system input for mt engines andon statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component . linguistic preprocessing in image data for researchers working with image data , there is currently underway an effort to augment ocr ( optical character recognition ) engines with linguistic data as they recognize and convert bitmap data into characters - - - similar to what has already been done in speech recognition with linguistic data in hmms ( hidden markov models ) . other ocr researchers have also experimented with image-level early topic detection using word-shape recognition . in principle , this could provide a first-step filtering of documents into a more homogeneous mt input set , a desirable goal for mt evaluation . thus we expect that individuals working with or intending to incorporate ocr into their computer systems will be interested in this new area . linguistic preprocessing in online data for those working with online input , even though the characters are already present , there often still remains the task of preprocessing meaningful , symbolic character strings that are not a part of the text to be translated . for some systems , the rules for identifying and encapsulating or removing such strings may need to be hand-crafted over time as mt engine limitations surface . for others , a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistically trained nl models has worked . many have observed that the html annotations , alphanumeric items , spreadsheet and word processing codes are harder to weed out than originally expected . research efforts with the low-density and less-commonly taught languages , as well as more common ones , encounter a substantial problem with variation in spelling conventions and transcription preferences . for those natural languages that are primarily spoken and not written , for example , this is frequently the case . researchers working on this class of problem have built variants on spell checkers ( sc ) , components that standardize words to one orthography ( spelling convention ) before submitting it to an mt engine . an idea that has arisen for this component is to build in an option to adjust the level of sc correction - - - as would be relevant when input after ocr nonetheless varies from very noisy to relatively clean . evaluation of embedded mt systems among those working on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component , we have seen two distinct trends . one group of statisticians has begun looking for appropriate models from outside the world of mt evaluation , examining the efforts by others to take distinct metrics for components and combine them for an overall system-level metric using fuzzy mathematics . another group of researchers is looking instead at developing a one-dimensional scale for ranking mt engines along a continuum defined by system-level function . that approach , for example , might rank one engine as good enough for filtering documents , while another engine deemed more linguistically robust would be ranked higher because it could generate a good enough initial translation for subsequent post-editing . we welcome other functional evaluations of mt components and computer systems with embedded mt components as well . submissions submitters are invited to send in a short paper , not more than 5 pages , addressing one or more of the three areas discussed above . papers should define the problem in an embedded mt system that is the focus of the work , describe the embedded mt system design ( a simple sketch ) with sample input data where relevant , and present their approach to the problem . work at various stages of completion is acceptable ; we expect the current status of the work to be made clear . submission of end-to - end output of an embedded mt system is especially encouraged . the papers will be collected and distributed to participants of theworkshop . ideally , the result of the workshop will be a clearer delineation of : ( 1 ) the range of linguistic preprocessing problems ( 2 ) the range of designs in embedded mt systems ( 3 ) how these problems aretreated in different embedded mt systems and ( 4 ) the metrics that are being used to evaluate these systems and their components . dates notice of interest in participation : july 10 , 1998 ( to voss @ arl . mil ) please identify which of the three areas you intend to address : preprocessing in image data , preprocessing in online data , evaluation of embedded mt systems . position paper submission : august 10 , 1998 notifications : september 10 , 1998 final copies of papers : october 10 , 1998 workshop : october 28 , 1998 submissions may be in printed or electronic form . submissions should be sent to : clare voss army research laboratory amsrl-is -

Marc -- Since perl itself is a scripting language, and allows code to be eval'ed,
I can't see why we need to go the whole hog and implement another
turing-complete scripting language in perl.Let's go back to *why* this would be useful.  As far as I can see, you're
proposing this to deal with multi-match rules.  There's already a tracker
in the bug DB for these, with a proposed implementation.  http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47I think this might have stalled due to shortcomings in the existnig
proposal, so I've just added my own thoughts on how to implement them. ;)
Comments on the proposed system would be welcome folks.... reply to the
bug db.--j.--

) - does the signer get the audiences attention ? ) - is the story well structured ? ) - is the story within the time limits set ( usually 3 minutes ) ? ) - does the signer keep to the rules ? ) this usually consists of - no dirty jokes . ) - no overzealous religious contexts . ) ) the competitior must give a title to his / her story and state its type , ( ie true ) story , joke story , sad story , not true story etc . . . ) ) ) if the story exceeds the time limit a point is deducted . however the signer is ) not interrupted if he / she exceeds the limit but is allowed to complete the ) story ( unless it really is too long ! ! ! ) . ) ) sometimes , at the end the winner ( if he / she is popular with the audience is ) asked to repeat it or give another story ) . ) ) . . . sign-singing is not too common among the deaf community far as i am ) aware . it is mostly done in religious situations . i think it is n't a strong ) component of deaf culture . however story-telling is a strong part of deaf ) culture and especially of making jokes and light-hearted teasing . anyway thats ) my deaf experience here in new zealand . ) from karina bingham ( karina @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu ) : ) there is an african - american a cappella group called "" sweet honey in the ) rock "" who have a full-time signer in the group . she performs with them and ) signs her interpretations of the songs . they recently published a book ) for their 25th anniversary : ) ) reagon , bernice johnson . the long journey home . 1994 . ) ) in which the signer discusses her experiences in the deaf community and ) a deaf church ( where the congregation sang in sign ) . her parents were both ) deaf ; she is not . ) from marina mcintire ( mmcintir @ lynx . dac . neu . edu ) : ) you have inadvertently touched upon a very tender issue in the deaf ) community here in the us . first , let me say that only in the us have i ) seen this phenomenon . brits ( both deaf and hearing who work with them ) ) are confounded and amused by it . in the us , it used to be quite the ) thing to translate songs and develop routines to go with them , produce ) recitals and concerts , and the like . it arose , most likely , out of a ) strong church-related tradition of "" helpers "" for deaf people . ) ) in the last ten to fifteen years , however , deaf people have begun their ) own liberation . song - signing has been a casualty , by and large . it is ) viewed as representing one aspect of a pathological or clinical view of ) deafness , i . e . , that the worst "" loss "" resulting from deafness is music . ) this is , of course , far from the truth . and for culturally deaf people , ) music is a peculiarity belonging to the mainstream hearing world and of ) no consequence in their lives whatsoever . so * that * motive ( helping ) d / deaf people appreciate what they ' re missing ) is not acceptable . ) ) another complaint is that , by and large , translations are more ) influenced by the rhythm of the music than by any sense it might make in ) asl , presenting d / deaf audiences with nonsensical or distorted versions ) of signs and signed syntax . this arises partly , of course , out of the ) difficulty of translating any poetry into any language . ) ) worst of all , and perhaps most puzzling to d / deaf people , is the ) insistence of most song-signers on including things like "" tra la la "" or ) humming . there is * nothing * that could make less sense to a d / deaf ) audience ! ) ) i will say that i have seen some wonderful song-sign translations done , ) including some with rather elegant dance routines . sometimes these have ) been done by d / deaf people and sometimes by hearing folks . by and large , ) however , this practice is no longer an acceptable pasttime in our ) community . exceptions are made , ironically , for interpreters who work in ) theater . musical productions , because of their general inclusion of ) dance ( a more interesting visual event ) and costume / props / etc . . . are ) quite popular and well-attended ( comparatively speaking ) by d / deaf ) theatre-goers . many thanks to all those who replied . randy lapolla institute of history and philology academia sinica",Safe Email

Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.  
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
 
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. ""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple Ã¢â‚¬Å“3Ã¢â‚¬Â Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:Ã¢â‚¬Å“To whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s & 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJÃ¢â‚¬ÂLocation: Midwest, U.S.A.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.Ã¢â‚¬Â-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAÃ¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a man of my 40Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and I really know my stuff.  I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple Ã¢â‚¬Å“3Ã¢â‚¬Â.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!Ã¢â‚¬Â  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom

392,"re : summary : ' no ' and ' man ' thanks for all the responses . it was really something to get the number and quality of ideas . 1 . ' no ' my initial query was : south african english use of ' no ' - does this occur in contexts such as : a . how are you ? b . no , i ' m fine . in other english varieties / other languages ? confronted with such examples , vistors to the country often comment that in sa english , ' no ' means ' yes ' . this , of course , is not true . ' no ' would be the response to the question ' do you have the time ? ' if the speaker did n't have the time . * generally : a couple of people commented that ' no ' definitely does not mean ' yes ' in these contexts . what it does is rather to negate the possibility of a negative belief concerning the answer to the question . in the example above , for instance , b . is negating a . 's possible belief that b . is not well . why south africans hold that the possibility of such negative beliefs is so strong they have to be denied remains to be seen . * ' no ' in other varieties of english the use of ' no ' in the types of examples cited anyway is not recorded according to the responses in : - australian english - american english - english english it is recorded in : - nigerian and ghanaian english there do appear to be related ( but not identical ) discourse uses of ' no ' and similar particles in other varieties of english . few english responses actually dealt with this usage at all . by far the majority were on ' man ' * ' no ' in other languages ' no ' does seem to be used in a variety of other languages in the same way as in sa english . similar uses are recorded in : - the scandinavian languages - german ( 'd och ' - similar but not identical ) - cameroon french - bangkok thai ( ' plaw ' - lit . ' empty ' ) - spanish ? it also occurs , incidentally , in afrikaans . 2 . ' man ' my question here related to the use of ' man ' to express a negative emotional involvement of the speaker of some sort - irritation , impatience or annoyance . examples given were : man it 's hot today hurry up mom , man man , i can't this right * english a huge response that showed that ' man ' is used similarly in : - american english ( both ' black ' and ' white ' ) - scottish english - tyneside english ( in north east of england ) - jamaican english - welsh english - an ' americanism ' found in other varieties of english . the american english usage at least does not necessary carry negative sentiment and is ' a more general tag . . . over which any kind of emotional intonation can be laid ' . example b . above , an example which typifies sa usage , was found to be odd ( ' wierd ' ) by american respondants . the reason for this is that ' man ' although an interjection still appears to ' have the flavour of a term of address so that ' mom , man ' sounds like two forms of direct address in a row ' . it seems , then , that ' man ' in sae does not bare the feature ' term of address ' at all in such contexts . the only instance in which similar usages were given was in tyneside english . ( ' shut up man geoff ' ' those kegs are too tight man mary ' . here though , the actual term of address occurs finally as opposed to the use of ' man ' finally in sae . this needs to be explored further , but of further interest : - there is a distinctly ' american ' use of ' man ' in sae that is not like the south african use of man ( ' cool man ' type of utterances ) . - other sa examples of man : - daddy , man ! ( 5 year old daughter after i stood on her toe ) - man , david , i do n't mean that ( wife and self in ' altercation ' ) - no man , that 's not right . - man ! this bloody computer is giving problems . - saenglish ' man ' alternates between shwa and full vowel in all contexts . ( in sae shwa occurs as a vowel in stressed contexts - 's it ' can have shwa for eg ) : related usage in currant american english is the use of 'd ude ' . * other languages related uses of ' man ' include : - dutch - swedish ( ' boy ' is used in a similar way ) - norwegian - ? german use of ' etwa ' may have similar function - german ( ' usually to indicate weariness ' ) - spanish - ? lhasa tibetan ( ' mi ' - ' person ' ) interestingly in dutch the 'd ouble address form [ as in ' hurry up mom , man ' ] is impossible ( just "" schiet op , man "" must do ) . ' some interesting stuff came out as you can see . just for your interest , on further sa english item : - ' sorry ' for ' i beg your pardon ' e . g . a drops something without knowing . b picks it up and calls out to a ' sorry , you dropped something ' anyway thanks to : helen adamson geoffrey sampson elin haf gruffyd jones celso alvarez caccamo mai kuha mark donohue marek przezdziecki scott delancey mats eeg-olofsson dom watt hilde hasselgard nicole nelson jane a . edwards sren harder charlie rowe nobue mori adiego lajara bruce connell krisadawan hongladarom frank bramlett deborah milam berkley douglas s oliver larry trask kristine hasund paul boersma m . lynne roecklein judy l . delin benji wald stephen p . spackman john verhaar randall major + the person who wished to be anonymous for the references .",Safe Email

This recommendation is based on the information that you will not betray the trust and confidence to be reposed in you. I am Romila Kabila the second son of the assassinated former President Of Democratic Republic Of Congo (D.C) Late Laurent Desire Kabila who on Tuesday 16 January   during the four years rule of my father I was his confidential/private security and base on my position of relationship of father and son. I was able to be in change of the president's personal security vault and some of his savings.Now following the death of my father, the immediate family of the late President Kabila has met and concluded that some savings and security vault of the former President should be moved out of the troubled Democratic Republic of Congo with immediate president of Democratic republic of Congo by the late Kabila has been appointed president of democratic republic of Congo by the late kabila's national executive council and the country top military brass, and properties worth millions of US$ to relocate the late president kabila's assets and properties with millions of dollars  to over sea country where there is good political climate. We have concluded arrangement to move/transfer the sum US$42M to a finance and security company in London through a Diplomatic courier services. The family through a diplomatic contact during my father's regime, conclude an arrangement to lodge/deposit the above sums with the GLOBAL DIPLOMATIC AND SECURITY SERVICES in LONDON - U.K!
. And it is on this, that I am soliciting for your assistance to help us receive this amount from this security company once it arrives London upon your acceptance to assist in this project as we the family member can not do it on our own because of the code of conduct, which was introduced by my late father to checkmate excess embezzlement/siphoning of the Government/public funds overseas country as the case had be during the Late President Mobutu Sese Seko. So one cannot make law and destroy the same law. Therefore if you can render your assistance, please indicate your interest to me through my email romkabila@presidency.com, you should then urgently arrange to travel to London and clear the (consignments) funds upon it arrival and subsequent payment of the US$42M into your bank account. As soon as we hear from you, we then send a representative to be with you in London to represent our interest. Based on your anticipated efforts and contri!
bution the family has resolved to give you 20% commission and the remaining 80% will be reclaimed by the family. It will be my pleasure to be able to co-operate with you on terms that you may wish for the successful completion of this project. Thanks and remain blessed.Best Regards,

( this is a key difference between this agreement and the socal mou . ) the other tenets of the deal would only have to be approved by the puc . in other words , sempra claims that it will be able to eliminate sdg & e ' s undercollect just by dealing with the puc rather than the legislature . sources suggest that this may be in reaction to the failure of the socal mou to move in the legislature . sources also indicate that the earlier trans - elect offer to purchase sdg & e lines for ( $ 1 . 8 b ) considerably less than the states bid only makes the california legislature more leery of approving the socal mou . mou attached below . davis kindles new fire over dwr contracts friday ' s release of the cadwr power contracts motioned republicans to begin a new wave of complaints against the governor remarking that the contract information was lacking and data that the public has a right to know had been blacked out . assembly member dave cox ( minority leader ) stated that the most troubling items were the clauses that exempt generators from having to pay windfall profit taxes or environmental penalties , and instead these would be paid by taxpayers . backlash from the republicans has been increasing as a new wave of california television commercials peg davis as the root of california ' s energy woes . ge out west sources report that there are 3 or 4 ge generator sets ( peaker plants ) on the market now for $ 14 - $ 15 m . this is because the people who bought these units do not want to go forward and get into the california market because it is "" too arbitrary . "" sources report that the sellers of these generator sets made this decision beginning approximately a week ago . additionally , sources believe that ge may move to cost - plus - based pricing for sellers of power in order to provide stable financing for generators over the long term , though this would mean less profits than in the past . pg & e executives profit even in bankruptcy as reported on 6 - 14 , sources continue to believe that socal executives are closely following the events unfolding in the pg & e bankruptcy case , as mentioned in last thursday ' s report "" judge montali approved large bonuses for pg & e senior management after pg & e ' s filing made bryson and other members of his team "" reconsider "" the merits of bankruptcy . "" today ' s news reports of judge montali ' s order providing pg & e executive with $ 17 . 5 m in bonuses just reiterates the point to bryson that pg & e executives remain well - paid even in bankruptcy thus suggesting socal could do equally well in the event of a filing . sources suggest that socal ' s current cash position weighs less heavily in determining a bankruptcy filing than the prospect of asset seizures / liens ( however , sources continue to make inquiries as to socal ' s cash flow situation . )",Safe Email

  | so I'll probably poke around at the sequences performance issues,Well, there's this wonderful piece of code in MhSeqExpand ...    # Hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that don't exist
    foreach m $rseq {
        if ![file exists $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m] {
            Exmh_Debug $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m not found
            set ix [lsearch $seq $m]

        } else {
            # Real hack
            break
        }
    }which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch
of messages that don't exist.   I'm not sure why it is important that the
first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any
of the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,
and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the
sequences it is looking at, all the time...It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the
context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.  | I'll email anything I figure out since I'm leaving town in less 
  | than 48 hours.Have a good vacation.kre_______________________________________________

Getting Business
Grants
Anyone thinking about going
into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where FREE business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the Federal
Government.
It
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:
Over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in FREE
consulting and research grants.
With an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
In
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.Government Grants

a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright
law, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of
others.....To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet
bookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will
bring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,
before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,
libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free
high-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
already in the public domain.--------I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and
saw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a
small satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding
machine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a
copy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total
fixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA
had the equipment donated) is under $10k.One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if
they wished, add these ""virtual holdings"" (public domain materials) to their
existing library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be
compelling to small libraries in remote areas.- Jim

AN INTERNET EIREANNACH............................Ping An Irish SongYet another Irish internet company, Octagon Technologies, closed for
good this week.  And after reading the phrase for what seemed like
the umpteen-thousandth time, we were idly wondering how many Irish
tech companies blamed their misfortunes ""on the global downturn"":
http://makeashorterlink.com/?S35A63392Oh, so it's about 450 then.  Thanks, Google.*The death occurred recently of that great Irish washtub musician
Lonnie Donegan.  RIP.  This seems like an apt time therefore to
reflect on his many accomplishments: his virtuoso playing of
utensil-based instruments, his worldwide commercial success, his
place in history as King of Skiffle, and how he wiped billions of
yen off the value of the Tokyo stock market:
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=373A9C4F.61B@time.life
(""panic and subsequent 10+% decline of Tokyo Stock Exchange when Reuters
advised 'Lonnie Donnegan' was dead"")
and also at
http://xsls.com?80
(""to Japanese ears it sounded like Ronald Reagan"").*UCD's Literary and Historical Society this week awarded an honorary
fellowship to the tediously brilliant American multidisciplarian Dr
Noam Chomsky.  Now the idea of some trifling college society
awarding a mere honorary fellowship actually sounds rather like an
insult to us, considering that Niall Quinn and Marian Finucane were
given *degrees* by DIT the very next day, but then Chomsky
apparently inspired some of Radiohead's most caterwaulingly blunted
songs, so we suppose it serves him right.  Anyway, if you're an
admirer of the great man's hermeutic genius, linguistic philosophy
or contentious views on US foreign policy, perhaps you might also
appreciate his amazing interview of Tom Hanks:
http://www.sadiethepilot.com/aaweb/tapes.htm#tomnnoamVery special thanks to IMHO's London correspondent Ray Butler for
this one.*Key IMHO contributor Sean Lynch quite realistically predicts a post-
Budget dole queue for all of us, and wonders if we'll miss those
cash-and-job cow multinationals when they're gone?   Not if their
Irish presence was as permanent and impressive as ""the world's
leading risk and insurance services firm"", he concludes:
http://www.marsh.ie
(compare and contrast with, say, http://www.marsh.co.uk/)*Also: we've been remiss in the past in not featuring
EircomTribunal.com's stalwart and righteous campaigning against
Eircom's crippling rates and crippled infrastructure in this
country.  Well, we aim to redress that right now, by pointing out
(1) Their 'Banana Republic' international price comparison page at
http://www.eircomtribunal.com/dossier_banana_rep.html, which will
surely make you mad enough to
(2) Download and print out their marvellously bitter ""No More
Favours For You, Mr Eircom Employee"" flyer from
http://www.eircomtribunal.com/counterstrike_a2_nomore.html, designed
to be stuck under the windshields of the ubiquitous and bilious
blue/orange Eircom vans.
Now if only EircomTribunal.com could somehow could retrieve that
money we all lost on bloody Eircom shares...

The Stephens Green Centre and show him what you can do.And hey, if you're a crazy maniac, that's great too.  It's about
time we had an Irish SANTACON - after all, no force on earth can
stop one hundred Santas, especially if they're drunk:
http://www.santarchy.com/
(from the San Francisco Police Report, ""the naughty Santas ... had
reeked (sic) havoc in the emporium ... in an un-Christmas like
fashion."")*Heh.  Disproving the stereotype that all accountants are boring:
some Dublin 2 company is looking for a ""Parti-time bookkeeper"" at
http://xsls.com?83*Our attention-deficient gaze also fell briefly this week onto a box
ad in a Sunday paper which is seeking private investors for an
ADVENTURE SPORTS RETAILING business in Dublin.  Now this probably
just means selling snowboards or something equally tame, but in our
imagination we see IMHO readers hunting elephants, dogfighting in
biplanes over the Wicklow Hills and abseiling down moon craters.
Just in case we're right, any ""smart, experienced partner/investor""
looking for an ""equity stake/board position"" should ""express""
""interest"" to neptune@atomic.ie.You know, it might look like we're giving these people free
advertising, but by putting their email addresses on the public web,
we're actually GUARANTEEING them spam...

IMHO'S PICK: EVENT...........................Allow Us To DemonstrateFriday is BUY NOTHING DAY.  For the sake of your own mental health
and the socio-economic future, we urge you to give it a try.  It's
not that hard to get through 24 hours without a purchase, and those
corporate balance sheets sure look funny with a big pre-Christmas
hole in them.The official home of BND is of course Adbusters
(http://adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/) and they have a run-down of
Irish activities at http://xsls.com?84... rather a disappointing line-up
at this late stage, although the Zombie-Shopping in Galway sounds
like fun - shame they're moving the day to Saturday, hopefully it's
not for purpose-defeating reasons (""Friday?  Damn, I'm working the
late shift at McDonald's... how about Saturday?"").  In addition and
elsewhere you can expect bring-and-trade markets, flypostering, free
stuff, public speaking and all the other happy faces of democratic
consumer agitation.  Punk's not dead!  Party for your right to
fight!  No Logo!  Hare Hare!  And so on.*We're now going to risk life and limb by mentioning an event which
is so diametrically opposed to the above that we might just bring
about the heat-death of the Internet by combining them in the one
newsletter.We speak of course of the benighted and spiritually-denuded sickness
of the TRILOGY FASHION SHOW in the RDS on December 4th, tickets
starting at ""just E50"" (but rising to E395 + VAT, natch).  The
advertising for this bleak celebration focuses entirely on ""the most
beautiful women in the world"" who will grace the Simmonscourt
Pavilion with their airbrushed emptiness: Tyra Banks, Sophie Dahl
and Anna Kournikova (not the virus) are the only names we recognise.
You have to pore pretty closely over the small print of the press
ads to divine that it's the ""new Escada Collection"" (the who now?)
they're modelling.  And in an utterly appropriate and inevitable
partnership, tickets are available from the cultural sewage
treatment system that is Ticketmaster.

IMHO'S PICK: DOWNLOAD..................Transparent and UnaccountableGiven our internet focus and the subversive nature of our scurrilous
publishing agenda, there is only one possible download
recommendation this week.  It's the brilliant GHOSTZILLA browser, a
creation of architectural genius which brings office escapism to
heady new heights.Designed to facilitate inconspicuous worktime browsing, Ghostzilla
sits quietly and invisibly in the background until you summon it
with a special mouse movement.  It then adapts itself to your
currently-uppermost application, for example Micro$oft Word, leaving
Word's toolbars intact while showing web pages in a subtle grayed-
out wash in the main window.  Images appear in a subdued two-tone
unless you summon them, and the overall effect is to make it look
like you're working exactly as you should be.  A casual glance from
your Office Space boss as he paces past your cubicle shouldn't
detect anything that looks like browsing.  To think that someone
devoted their life to creating something so wonderfully juvenile!
It's a beautiful thing.  Go ghosting at
http://www.ghostzilla.com.

IMHO'S PICK: INTERNET^HWS................................ON YER BIKERoll up, roll up roll up!  Segue right this way!  Amazon is now
selling the celebrated SEGWAY (aka Ginger, aka IT) online, the hype
of the millennium finally made available to lowly consumers.  You're
only four months and five thousands bucks away from participating in
the future of transport, the most fundamental and significant
breakthrough in human evolution since the invention of the leg, the
""spirit that can change the world"", etc. etc.Get out your chequebook and get your Segway at

(whoah! Easy, Chomsky!) is the utterly compelling 'Hoax Photo Test'
at http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/tests/hoaxphototest.html(If you've seen this already, that's prolly 'cos the mighty B3TA.com
featured it last Friday - credit where it's due)*""Imagine being able to run a Google-like search on your life,"" says
one of the prophets of doom behind MyLifeBits, an incredibly Dickian
personalised self-database being developed by - who else? -
Microsoft.  By cataloguing every single artifact of your life
history, storing everything in an online repository, you build a
searchable index of every conversation, document, movement, event
and action that you ever generate or perform.  It's a continuous
real-time alibi recorder.  It's a voluntary submission of every
second of existence to information overload.  It's a system that can
show you all the photos you were ever in, tell you exactly how many
phonecalls you've ever made, or retrieve an mpeg of you going to the
toilet in March, 1986:
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993084Also: we knew that modern innovation was roaring ahead at a
blistering pace, but can MyLifeBits really allow ""time-shifting""?

cousins - even in things you'd expect us to be good at, like
vandalism.  Here we get inarticulate clowns with cans of red paint
daubing ""666"" on the gates of Cardinal Connell's palatial Drumcondra
residence... whereas in Paris, to pick an example out of the blue,
egghead situationists sneakily attach absurdist plaques (e.g. ""On
April 17, 1967, nothing happened here"") onto public buildings:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2478161.stm*Microsoft have co-opted the AmIHotOrNot concept, as is their wont, mixed

LEGACY MEDIA.................There Was Nothing In The Air That NightIRISH TV: If you rush straight home from work after reading this on
Thursday, you might catch the second semi-final of corny but
challenging elimination quiz IT'S NOT THE ANSWER (RTE1, 17:30).
Come on the beardy guy!  The final's on at the same time tomorrow.
Calm down from all that excitement with the laughable one-hour FAIR
CITY murder trial special (RTE1, 20:00) - it's quite brilliant how
the risible scripts really bring out the absolute worst in truly
terrible actors.  Settle down with a few G&Ts to watch PRIME TIME on
the same channel at 21:30, where they're discussing Ireland's
alcoholic epidemic and its attendant social problems, or waste them
on either the bottom-scraping POLICE ACADEMY 3 (N2, 21:30) or the
geriatric 1978 blockbuster COMA (TG4, 22:05).Friday night, and after a hard day of buying nothing you can flop in
front of creepy Hitler doco SIX MOST EVIL MEN (N2, 21:00).  Near as
we can tell, the other evil men are Macauley Culkin in UNCLE BUCK
(TV3, 20:00), gossip columnist WINCHELL in a solid eponymous biopic
(N2, 21:30), the big boss bad guy - is it Kang? Kane? Cowen? - in
MORTAL KOMBAT (TG4, 21:25), Mel Gibson in predictable 80s drug
thriller TEQUILA SUNRISE (RTE1, 23:50), and Quentin Tarantino
jumping on his own bandwagon in DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO (TV3,
0:50).  Hang on, Dave Fanning might be one of the evil men too: he's
presenting THE LAST BROADCAST on Network 2 at 23:35.

which can compromise your system, read your address book/whitelist, and
sent themselves on, compromising a nonnegligible fraction of systems as
they go along. While mailing lists can be spam/worm amplifiers, I don't think this is
true for individual users even today. Moreover, worms which use email as
vector exist *only* because a single vendor ships mailers with broken
default settings, and insists to make documents executables. This makes
for very bad press, and eventually that vendor is going to wise up, and 
stop shipping as many broken wares (or people will switch to more secure 
alternatives, whatever comes first).http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

 ""Like everyone else, I had become a
slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
If I saw something like clever coffee
table sin the shape of a yin and yang,
I had to have it. I would flip through
catalogs and wonder, ""What kind of dining
set defines me as a person?"" We used to
read pornography. Now it was the Horchow
Collection. I had it all. Even the glass
dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
proof they were crafted by the honest,
simple, hard-working indigenous peoples of
wherever.""
 - Jack, Fight Club 
In Fight Club, Tyler Durden destroys this nesting instinct by *bombing* 
Jack's apartment. Hmmmm.

Date: Not suppliedThe DoE has announced a high-speed data-transfer that runs on drillpipe, 
through ""a 4-inch diameter steel pipe immersed in electrically conductive mud 
at pressures up to 1000 atmospheres, temperatures up to 150 deg C, and with 
vibrational accelerations of hundreds of g's:""     Now, with a high-speed, bi-directional communications link, a drilling 
    system's azimuth, inclination, pressure, temperature, loads and vibration, 
    along with information on rock characteristics near the drill bit, can be 
    evaluated almost instantly. Also, because of the ability to send high-speed 
    data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable Ã¯Â¿Â½ such 
    as collecting seismic data at the drill bit Ã¯Â¿Â½ may now be possible.     With high-resolution seismic data collected ""ahead of the bit,"" operators 
    could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet 
    spots and away from less productive areas. This will enhance the efficiency 
    of oil and gas wells and reduce the number of wells needed to produce a 
    reservoir.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)[1] http://www.fossil.energy.gov/techline/tl_intellipipe.shtml

605,"subcategorization in tranformational grammar dear colleagues , i ' m wondering if someone could give me some pointers to the latest literature in transformational grammar ( gb , p&p , minimalism ) that deals with issues of subcategorization . in particular i would like to get a sense of the latest thinking , including ways in which minimalism departs from previous assumptions . among the questions that i would ideally like to see addressed are the following : - what kind of subcategorization relations have been assumed in the recent literature , and for what kinds of phenomena ? for instance , a transitive verb must somehow encode the requirement of taking a dp complement . but can a verb also take a pp complement according to the identity of that pp 's head ( as in _ rely _ + _ on _ ) ? - how are subcategorization relations constrained ? that is , what syntactic ( or semantic ) properties are thought to be accessible ( in the limit ) to the selecting head ? - if there are substantive formal constraints on subcategorization , where do they come from ? is there anything in the architecture of the theory from which such constraints would follow ? thanks very much , - - andreas kathol",Safe Email

( note that this is 3 days after their authority expires ) ferc will release its proposed order on 11 / 1 / 2000 based on the results of its 206 investigation of the california wholesale power markets . we don ' t know what they will find or what they will propose . the proposed order will have a 30 day comment period , after which ferc will likely issue a final order . ferc will be accepting oral comments on 11 / 9 / 2000 in washington . enron still has to determine who will provide oral comments . many companies have filed at ferc advocating or opposing a litany of price caps , cost based rates , and market redesign recommendations . it is likely that the price caps approved by the iso board will go into effect . how long they will remain in effect will depend on whether ferc extends the iso price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy . impact of price caps the attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at different gas price levels . we think that this is the highest that markets would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap . it is hard to say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap because we don ' t know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the cap . the assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below . take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000 . calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load , new price cap methodology , and a range of gas prices . divide historical hours into peak and off - peak buckets . calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off - peak hours . for example , we have two years worth of data for the months of january through september . each month has approximately 400 hours . for january through september , we took approximately 800 observations for each month ( 400 from each year ) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual observations . we created a peak table and an off - peak table . the table shows the calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices for each month . this value represents what the month would clear at if each hour cleared at the cap ( based on historic loads ) . while any given hour could be above this value , our calculation estimates the likely monthly average cap value ! the blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current ( 10 / 27 / 2000 nymex ) forward prices . the yellow shading indicates those forward power prices which are in excess of the proposed cap .",Safe Email

630,"chechen who are the chechen ? johanna nichols university of california , berkeley author 's note : i have been doing linguistic field work on chechen and its close relative ingush for many years . though i am not an ethnographer or historian , i have tried to bring together here some general information about the chechen people and their language in order to increase public awareness of the people and their situation , and to put a human face on a people of great dignity , refinement , and courage who have paid heavily for their resistance to conquest and assimilation . this paper may be copied freely . if you disseminate it electronically or print it out yourself ( which you are welcome to do ) , reformatting ( font , spacing , etc . ) is ok but please do not edit it . johanna @ uclink . berkeley . edu fax : 510 642-6220 phone ( 510 ) 642-2979 introduction . the chechens and their western neighbors the ingush are distinct ethnic groups with distinct languages , but so closely related and so similar that it is convenient to describe them together . the term "" chechen "" is a russian ethnonym taken from the name of a lowlands chechen village ; "" chechnya "" is derived from that . ( both words are accented on the last syllable in russian . ) this term evidently entered russian from a turkic language , probably kumyk ( spoken in the northern and eastern caucasian plain ) . the chechens call themselves nokhchi ( singular nokhchuo ) . similarly , "" ingush "" is not the self-designation but a russian ethnonym based on a village name ; the ingush call themselves ghalghay . demography . 1989 census figures : 956 , 879 chechen ; 237 , 438 ingush . the chechens are the largest north caucasian group and the second largest caucasian group ( after the georgians ) . location , settlement . the chechen and ingush lands lie just to the east of the principal road crossing the central caucasus ( via the darial pass ) , extending from the foothills and plains into alpine highlands . the lowlands enjoy fertile soil , ample rainfall , a long growing season , and a small oilfield . neighbors to the east are the various peoples of daghestan ( many of them speaking languages related to chechen ) ; in the plains to the north , the turkic - speaking kumyk and ( as of the last three centuries ) russians ; to the west the ingush and to their west the ossetians , who speak a language of the iranian branch of indo - european ; to the south ( across the central caucasus range ) the southern ossetians and the georgians . there are two true cities in chechen and ingush territory : grozny ( pop . about 400 , 000 until 1995 ) , the modern chechen capital founded as a russian fort during the russian conquest of the caucasus ; and vladikavkaz ( pop . about 300 , 000 ; known as ordzhonikidze in soviet times ) in the ingush highlands at the ingush - ossetic territorial boundary , also originally a russian military fort and founded to control the darial pass . nazran in the ingush lowlands was traditionally and is now a large and important market town . the cities had substantial russian and other non - chechen - ingush population ; vladikavkaz was mixed ingush and ossetic with significant numbers of russians and georgians . ( groznyj has now been destroyed and mostly depopulated by russian bombing . vladikavkaz and the adjacent ingush lands were ethnically cleansed of ingush in late 1992 . ) all russian governments - - czars , soviets , post - soviet russia - - have used various means to remove chechen and ingush population from economically important areas and to encourage settlement there by russians and russian cossacks ; hence the mixed population of the cities and lowlands . language . the caucasus has been famed since antiquity for the sheer number and diversity of its languages and for the exotic grammatical structures of the language families indigenous there . this diversity testifies to millennia of generally peaceable relations among autonomous ethnic groups . chechen and ingush , together with batsbi or tsova - tush ( a moribund minority language of georgia ) make up the nakh branch of the nakh - daghestanian , or northeast caucasian , language family . there are over 30 languages in the northeast caucasian family , most of them spoken in daghestan just to the east of chechnya . the split of the nakh branch from the rest of the family took place about 5000-6000 years ago ( thus the nakh - daghestanian family is comparable in age to indo - european , the language family ancestral to english , french , russian , greek , hindi , etc . ) , though the split of chechen from ingush probably dates back only to the middle ages . the entire family is indigenous to the caucasus mountains and has no demonstrable relations to any language group either in or out of the caucasus . like most indigenous caucasian languages chechen has a wealth of consonants , including uvular and pharyngeal sounds like those of arabic and glottalized or ejective consonants like those of many native american languages ; and a large vowel system somewhat resembling that of swedish or german . like its sister languages chechen has extensive inflectional morphology including a dozen nominal cases and several gender classes , and forms long and complex sentences by chaining participial clauses together . the case system is ergative , i . e . the subject of a transitive verb appears in an oblique case and the direct object is in the nominative , as is the subject of an intransitive verb ( as in basque ) ; verbs take no person agreement , but some of them agree in gender with the direct object or intransitive subject . 97 % or more of the chechens claim chechen as their first language , though most also speak russian , generally quite fluently . chechen and ingush are so close to each other that with some practice a speaker of one has fair comprehension of the other , and where the two languages are in contact they are used together : a chechen addresses an ingush in chechen , the ingush replies in ingush , and communication proceeds more or less smoothly . chechen was not traditionally a written language . an orthography using the russian alphabet was created in the 1930 's and is used for various kinds of publication , although for most chechens the chief vehicle of literacy is russian . traditionally , as in most north caucasian societies , many individuals were bilingual or multilingual , using an important lowlands language ( e . g . kumyk , spoken in market towns and prestigious as its speakers were early converts to islam ) for inter-ethnic communication ; any literacy was in arabic . russian has now displaced both kumyk and arabic in these functions . particularly if the chechen and ingush economies continue to be destroyed and unemployment and mass homelessness continue to undermine the social structure , there is danger that chechen and ingush will be functionally reduced to household languages and will then yield completely to russian , with concomitant loss of much of the cultural heritage . history . the chechens have evidently been in or near their present territory for some 6000 years and perhaps much longer ; there is fairly seamless archeological continuity for the last 8000 years or more in central daghestan , suggesting that the nakh - daghestanian language family is long indigenous . the caucasian highlands were apparently relatively populous and prosperous in ancient times . from the late middle ages until the 19th century , a worldwide cooling phase known as the little ice age caused glacial advances and shortened growing seasons in the alpine highlands , weakening the highland economies and triggering migrations to the lowlands and abandonment of some alpine villages . this period of economic hardship coincided with the russian conquest of the caucasus which lasted from the late 1500 's to the mid - 1800 's . in all of recorded history and inferable prehistory the chechens ( and for that matter the ingush ) have never undertaken battle except in defense . the russian conquest of the caucasus was difficult and bloody , and the chechens and ingush with their extensive lowlands territory and access to the central pass were prime targets and were among the most tenacious defenders . russia destroyed lowlands villages and deported , exiled , or slaughtered civilian population , forcing capitulation of the highlands . numerous refugees migrated or were deported to various muslim countries of the middle east , and to this day there are chechen populations in jordan and turkey . since then there have been various chechen rebellions against russian and soviet power , as well as resistance to collectivization , anti-religious campaigns , and russification . in 1944 the chechens and ingush , together with the karachay - balkar , crimean tatars , and other nationalities were deported en masse to kazakhstan and siberia , losing at least one-quarter and perhaps half of their population in transit . though "" rehabilitated "" in 1956 and allowed to return in 1957 , they lost land , economic resources , and civil rights ; since then , under both soviet and post - soviet governments , they have been the objects of ( official and unofficial ) discrimination and discriminatory public discourse . in recent years , russian media have depicted the chechen nation and / or nationality as thugs and bandits responsible for organized crime and street violence in russia . in late 1992 russian tanks and troops , sent to the north caucasus ostensibly as peacekeepers in an ethnic dispute between ingush and ossetians over traditional ingush lands politically incorporated into north ossetia after the 1944 deportation , forcibly removed the ingush population from north ossetia and destroyed the ingush villages there ; there were many deaths and there are now said to be up to 60 , 000 refugees in ingushetia ( about one-quarter of the total ingush population ) . in developments reminiscent of today 's invasion of chechnya , in the weeks leading up to the action the ingush were depicted ( inaccurately ) in regional media as heavily armed and poised for a large-scale and organized attack on ossetians , and the russian military once deployed appears to have undertaken ethnic cleansing at least partly on its own initiative . ( my only sources of information for this paragraph are russian and western news reports . helsinki watch is preparing a report for publication in early 1995 . ) the invasion of chechnya presently underway has meant great human suffering for all residents of the chechen lowlands , including russians , but only the chechens are at risk of ethnic cleansing , wholesale economic ruin , and loss of linguistic and cultural heritage . religion . the chechens and ingush are sunni muslims of the hanafi school , having converted in the late 17th to early 19th centuries . islam is now , as it has been since the conversion , moderate but strongly held and a central component of the culture and the ethnic identity . economy , customs . traditionally , the lowlands chechen were grain farmers and the highlanders raised sheep . at the time of russian contact the lowlands were wealthy and produced a grain surplus , while the highlands were not self-sufficient in food and traded wool and eggs for lowlands grain . chechen social structure and ethnic identity rest on principles of family and clan honor , respect for and deference to one 's elders , hospitality , formal and dignified relations between families and clans , and courteous and formal public and private behavior . kinship and clan structure are patriarchal , but women have full social and professional equality and prospects for financial independence equivalent to those of men . academics , writers , artists , and intellectuals in general are well versed in the cultures of both the european and the islamic worlds , and the society as a whole can be said to regard both of these heritages as their own together with the indigenous north caucasian artistic and intellectual tradition . social organization . until the russian conquest the chechens were an independent nation with their own language and territory but no formal political organization . villages were autonomous , as were clans . villages had mutual defense obligations in times of war , and clans had mutual support relations that linked them into larger clan confederations ( which generally coincided with dialects ) . each clan was headed by a respected elder . there were no social classes and no differences of rank apart from those of age , kinship , and earned social honor . select bibliography anonymous . 1992 . ethnic cleansing comes to russia . the economist , november 28 , 1992 , p . 60 . blanch , lesley . 1960 . the sabres of paradise . new york : viking . comrie , bernard . 1981 . the languages of the soviet union . cambridge : cambridge university press . conquest , robert . 1970 . the nation killers : the soviet deportation of nationalities . london : macmillan . critchlow , james . 1991 .

633,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,806579,00.htmlLioness adopts fifth antelopeRory Carroll, Africa correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The GuardianKamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting
her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled
wildlife experts.
The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her
latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.
Each time Kamuniak, whose name means ""the blessed one"" in the local Samburu
tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed
the natural mothers to feed them.
Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while
Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by
their natural mothers.
The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (""taken by
force""), was adopted at the weekend.
""She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony,"" said
Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden.
Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a
distance.
Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak
is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are
cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour
and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants
to be loved. ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

Ah.  Neither Ted nor I were particularly up to date.  I pulled 
down the lates from CVS and am now running with it.  I miss the 
blue ftoc lines but I'll sort that out soon, iirc Chris said 
it's a simple resource change.Ted's code to ""ketchup"" made use of some of the procs that went 
away in the sequence generalization.  I've fixed it up... almost 
and it looks like this now:proc Cabeen_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh mhProfile msg
    set results {}
    Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set unseen [Mh_Sequence $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) ]
    foreach elem $unseen {
         if { $elem <= $msg(id) } {
            lappend results $elem
         }
    }
    busy Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}
The ""almost"" is because it's not updating the highlighting on 
the ftoc.  I'm too tired to go figure out how to fix that just 
now and have to move on to other stuff.  If someone wants to 
forward me a clue feel free.Now that I've got all of Chris' sequence stuff I discovered that 
my sequences are ... cluttered.--Hal

Date: Not suppliedI received some feedback in email (from several of you actually) regarding my 
earlier blog about the Parents Television Council[1], which recently published 
a report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for 
children. Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like 
GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply 
warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is 
a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of 
primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should 
air during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to 
restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The 
shows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and 
some aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents 
and children wish to watch TV together during this hour.It should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television 
viewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then 
don't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or 
shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because 
you don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let 
your kids watch it.The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example 
of one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show 
inappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems 
appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their 
ultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn't really mind, but the idea that 
all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.[1] http://www.parentstv.org/

and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already
installed is beyond me.Kate--

by
John SterneThe launch last month of a marketing special interest group by the
Irish Linux Users Group (ILUG)  -  open source and marketing, it
seems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts  -  has already
sparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork.  When
the new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will
be offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a
training class for staff at the UCC computer science department.
Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the
Linux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish
universities.The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme
that aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source
style of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educational
channel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software
with its operating environment and offering networked support
services to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designed
to suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to
schools and universities throughout the world.Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance
features and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to
master on personal systems.The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red
Hat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial
services for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until now
its involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,
although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in
Europe that offer consulting or technical support services.David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,
sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take
a more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, his
office in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish
companies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced
some to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.
-------------
Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.Regards

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately",Phishing Email

664,"california update 4 / 27 / 01 the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion . executive summary : ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal 1 . ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation . it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan . 2 . something less than effective price caps from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws : ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california . ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling . ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion . ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc . 3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse . 4 . growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power . the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california . the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months . 5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline . 6 delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated . 7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge . 8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay .",Safe Email

671,"linguistic theory dominique sportiche , partitions and atoms of clause structure subjects , agreement , case and clitics this collection builds on the theory of principles and parameters and its economy - - minimalist descendants . the essays progressively develop a view of syntactic structures in which syntactic properties are increasingly analyzed as atomized in progressively smaller elementary components and partitioned in the way these elementary components are represented . dominique sportiche argues that as a consequence of this view , languages do not differ at all in their syntactic organization . routledge leading linguists routledge : 1998 : 448 pp cl : 0 415 16926 7 : # d4946 : $ 110 . 00 laura a . michaelis , aspectual grammar and past time reference this work examines the linguistic constructions which speakers use to talk about events that occurred in the past and states which held in the past . laura michaelis argues that the fundamental conceptual division between events and states forms the basis of systems of verbal aspect in all languages , and that one cannot talk about the meaning of a past-tense assertion without making reference to the event-state distinction . focusing on english data , the author examines the semantic and functional overlap between assertions about the past and assertions involving events : when one asserts that an event of a given kind exists , one is making an assertion about the past . this semantic overlap can be evoked as a way of characterizing the close relationship between the past-tense construction and the past-perfect construction : while a past tense assertion like she left is used to describe the past , a present-perfect assertion like she has left is used to assert the existence of an event by invoking its aftermath ( her absence ) . dr . michaelis argues that the two constructions are semantically equivalent , but distinguished by their function in narrative . this study presents a semantic framework for analyzing all aspectual constructions in terms of the event-state distinction , and describes the grammatical expression of aspectual meaning in terms of a theory of grammatical constructions . in this theory , grammatical constructions , like words , are conventionalized form-meaning pairs , which are best described not only with respect to their intrinsic semantic values , but also with respect to the functional opposition in which they participate . michaelis argues that many of the otherwise puzzling grammatical constraints which characterize the english present-perfect construction can be motivated in terms of the functional opposition between present perfect and past tense . routledge studies in germanic linguistics 4 routledge : 1998 : 320 pp cl : 0 415 15678 5 : # d4385 : $ 90 . 00 asa kasher , ed , pragmatics 6 volume set the purpose of this collection is to portray the development of pragmatics as a science of language , in a such a way as to enable readers to critically assess this theorectical development . issues explored include * presupposition * implicature * discourse * grammar * communication * indexicals * psychology * sociology . this work provides highly useful references and suggestions for further reading , and has an exceptionally detailed subject and name index to enable easy and immediate access for the reader . critical concepts routledge : 1998 : 2653 pp cl : 0 415 11734 8 : # d2960 : $ 905 . 00 for more information on these and other titles from : routledge london * new york in north america : www . routledge-ny . com elsewhere : www . routledge . com",Safe Email

679,"Long time no chat!How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.Ã‚Â  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.Ã‚Â  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""Ã‚Â  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.Ã‚Â  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!Ã‚Â  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.Ã‚Â  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.Ã‚Â I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! Here is the bottom line ...I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.Ã‚Â  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!Ã‚Â  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.Ã‚Â  This is my
pledge to you.BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!Ã‚Â  To order Extreme Power Plus on our secure server, just click

consists of wvWare, which as the manpage says ""converts word documents
into other formats such as PS, PDF, HTML, LaTeX, DVI, ABW"".  HTML would
probably be the best format for use with Plucker/SiteScooper, depending
on how good the DOC --> HTML conversion is.  i haven't used either in
over a year as AbiWord or OpenOffice work well enough.  (prefer AbiWord
for it's light-weight size, but OpenOffice has the better DOC importer.)don't know which of these are better or worse than the other, but i

PalmOS-friendly as you can get.  never tried/needed it, but it's listed
there in the ""Save As"" dialog box.Wine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word
Viewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn't a year or so ago when
i last tried.  Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
Word 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &
paste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only
version of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.> > I don't have a Windows machine, so it becomes problematic to convert them;

significant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?)  since
OpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the
simple Word documents i receive from others).anyways...

Kragen, do you know of any?I personally have FoRK delivered to an address (napier%waste.org)
that has SpamAssassin enabled, agressively, where it just nukes
anything it thinks is spam. Usually I figure if I miss a FoRK post,
no big deal, I'll pick it up by the replies if it's interesting.For personal mail (joe%barrera.org) I either don't use SpamAssassin,
or use it but where it just flags messages instead of nuking them.
So if someone is sending a message just to me, I'll get it even
if it looks like spam.So in other words, Rohit, if you had sent to joe%barrera.org, I
guess I would have received it in a timely fashion.So where's all that booze? When's the retry?

like so:
rpm -e [rpm package]
and it gives the error: package not installed, so i install it like
so:
rpm -i [rpm package]

Last week, when indexing stuff for WhoisIreland.com, I noticed that
ns0.domainregistry.ie and banba.domainregistry.ie were out of synch by a
few days. The other nameservers seemed to give a current SOA at that
time. However the affected secondaries may have been using
ns0.domainregistry.ie for axfr and propagated the error.This whole thing does seriously bring into question IEDR's decision to
outsource the technical admininstration of .ie to a company that
apparently does not even admin its own DNS.  It is a nice story though -
almost as good as the time that .ie disappeared for 8 hours in July
1998.Regards...jmcc

730,"Hi,when testing spamassassin, i found a little problem but
I don't know if it's spamassassin or my pop3-server
that caused it.Pop3-servers seem to expect a blank line before ""From ""-lines
to seperate mails in a mailbox-file.
Spamassassin does not add such a blank line before
mails delivered directly to mailbox.
Result is that the pop3-server (tested with qpopper4 and
cucipop) delivers some mails glued together.I think the solution is to write a blank line to the mailbox
befor spamassassin adds the filtered mail.Please tell me if you're not the right man for this,
 if i'm totally wrong or if you're sure, the pop3-server
 shouldn't insist on a blank line before ""From ""-lines.Thank you.PS: Mailserver ist postfix-1.1.11Regards,--

lately I've got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower. I 
just decided to check that vs. reality, and yes, speed has left the 
scene somewhere between the release of 2.5 and now.I checked on a number of small messages in a big folder (~10000 
msgs). The delay of the Next button has increased considerably:2.5-release: 350-450 msec
latest cvs: 1000-12000 msecFrankly I think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the 
user settings hasn't changed.Anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared?/Anders_______________________________________________

I am HAJIYA MARYAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria Head of State,General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June, 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship. I currently have within my reach the sum of THIRTY FIVE MILLION US Dollars (US$35,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment, like Real Estate Development or import/export business specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant Project. The Russian Partners returned my husband's share of USD$35,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and lodged in my husband's security company of which l am director right now, the new Civilian Government have intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the US$3!
 5,000,000.00 from the company's vault and deposited in another private security company vault within the country. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian. Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website : www.thisdayonline.com , click on archives,8th. june, 2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, l proposed a percentage of 3!
 0% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, 10
% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the course of this transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address above. l must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while await your prompt response. NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, l have decided that this transaction be kept in utmost secrecy, remember to include your private Telephone or fax number for easy communication. You can also contact my trusted friend and family attorney,Barrister Aishat Gidado at aishatgidado@go.com or her number 248033044180.

For example: ""Terence Ross of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the news publishers' attorney, even told me that he thinks Internet users who configure their browsers to disable graphics (a common tactic to boost the speed of Web surfing) are committing copyright infringement because they are interfering with Web publishers' exclusive right to control how their pages are displayed.""Doug Isenberg, Esq.

756,"gq magazine : do you need a companion enough minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning . the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season . government spokesman raanan gissin said four soldiers were killed . six people were taken to hospital - - four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military sources said . the sources said another soldier remained beneath the rubble . gissin said rescue operations were continuing sunday night . the attack "" indicates that unless there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . "" shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .",Phishing Email

distributed as a binary tarball only, and I repackaged it based
originally on an earlier version of rar I found on the net, just for

difficult case are those whose back-end business
can be executed entirely in a foreign nation, such
as the 419 spammers. And you're right: there's not
much we can do about those, except filter them in
various ways. But the vast majority of spammers
have a back-end business that requires a native
presence. Debt consolidation. Mortgages. Herbalife
and other MLMs. Even porn sites require credit
card transactions. That means the people responsible
CAN be found.>I don't know of any law that specifically /exempts/ them from lawsuits, 
>it's just that no one has yet succeeded in any important way.There have been some successful suits, but (a) it
takes too much effort, and (b) the result isn't enough
to deter the spammer. But you're talking about action
constrained by law. In an anarchy, people act more
directly, with less cost, and to more effect. Spammers
very quickly would learn their lesson. Except for the
ones who ply their scam in a foreign country.Of course, that's assuming there are ISPs and other
infrastructure in an anarchy. Arguing about how things

of counterfactual reasoning.>no lawmaker has ever been even a tenth the catalyst on improving the

As to the crapper, it did not do nearly as much to
improve waste management in cities as did the public
sewers which it feeds, and the water lines that supply
it. Without these, you would find that a chamber pot
works just as well.

788,"My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.I need those houses...Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com Best Wishes,

I'll give it another go tonight, maybe come back with some error messages.Just to clarify for those who didn't understand me initially - I have a
floppy drive installed, but it doesn't physically work. There's nowhere
handy to pick one up where I am, and I don't fancy waiting a few days for
one to arrive from Peats.Thanks for the answers,

803,"competitive analysis update # 18 - us terrorism attacks political / security update : headlines ? taliban to declare "" jihad "" against the us if afghanistan targeted ; heightening expectations for retaliatory attacks against us targets . ? bush stokes unease among allies and international press with call for bin ladin to be brought to the u . s . , "" dead or alive . "" ? taliban offers to deliver bin ladin to a third country , likely a muslim country . offer almost certain to be rejected by bush administration . ? fbi arrests five additional suspected hijackers ; raising expectations for further attacks ? u . s . officials to meet with saudi foreign minister in washington ; questions to be asked about involvement of sons of saudi diplomat in attacks analysis ? efforts by the bush administration to build a multilateral coalition against terrorism will have to address two key foreign policy issues : iraq and the israel - palestinian peace process . missteps in either area could weaken the emerging multilateral coalition against terrorism and have important implications for the oil market . ? for a multilateral approach to work in the long term , the administration will need to provide countries with incentives to cooperate in the anti - terrorism campaign , especially in places such as the moderate arab states where dismantling the networks suspected of supporting terrorist groups will involve moving against internal targets . moreover , the administration will need to deal with the root causes that provide willing cadres to extremist groups , especially economic problems and political disenfranchisement . dealing with all of these factors will necessitate us financial support as well as greater us imagination in dealing with lingering regional issues . policy towards iraq . ? washington appears to be resisting attempts to broaden its attacks to include iraq at this point , despite internal and external pressure for such action . this will be a leading indicator , assuming that no firm proof of baghdad ' s involvement in the bombings is uncovered . a more aggressive us approach towards iraq has seemed likely since july when moscow blocked the introduction of "" smart sanctions "" during the last rollover of the oil - for - food program . ? however , given regional sensitivities in the arab world to washington ' s iraq policy and the interests that states such as russia and to a lesser extent china have in the country , the bush administration cannot have both a genuinely multilateral approach to anti - terrorism and an unilateral hard - line iraqi policy . it will need to chose between one or the other . israeli - palestinian peace process . ? without an equitable solution to this conflict , most experts believe that the bush team ' s anti - terrorism coalition is doomed to failure . ? initially , at least , the signs are not good : the sharon government in israel has been resistant to us pressure to rein in its aggressive policies towards the palestinians ? washington ' s willingness to confront israel on this issue will give a clue to its willingness to stay the anti - terrorism course and hold its broad coalition together . market update : us equities : ? next 48 hours seen as critical after yesterday ' s losses and fed cut . 8750 on dow seen as key resistance point : looking for decisive close below 8750 , not just intra - day test . downside risk seen to 7500 if the 8750 area doesn ' t hold : 7500 key b / c it was the nadir of asian crisis . ? two wildcards : company warnings : will the torrent continue ?

827,"Thank you for your interest!Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in ""How to Collect MoneyJudgments""If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
You have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""I am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now""After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">From the above information and actual results you can see

1. Turns of Phrase: Beanpole family
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Historically, families have usually had more children than parents,
resulting in family trees that looked like pyramids. However, in
recent years, especially in countries like Britain and the US, the
number of children per generation has steadily gone down, while
life span has increased. This has led to a shape of family tree
that some researchers have likened to a beanpole - tall and thin,
with few people in each generation. The term ""beanpole family"" has
been around in the academic literature at least since 1987, but it
rarely appears elsewhere. A recent British report has brought it to
wider public notice, at least in the UK. Some researchers find it
too slangy and prefer the jargon term ""verticalised"" to describe
such families. Whatever term you prefer, specialists are sure that
the demographic shift is having a big effect on personal
relationships within the family and (for example) the role of
grandparents.The rising divorce rate partly explains the growth of the
'beanpole' family. With almost one in two marriages ending in
divorce, many adults have at least two families, each with a single
child.
                                             [""Observer"", May 2002]Noting the rising number of so-called 'beanpole' families in
Britain (families with only one child), the report warns that a
child without siblings 'is starved of the companionship of family
members of their own age ... [leading to] greater social isolation,
with teenagers adopting a more selfish attitude to life'.
                                            [""Guardian"", June 2002]
2. Weird Words: Jobbernowl
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A stupid person, a blockhead.Unfortunately, this useful and effective insult has rather dropped
out of use in these mealy-mouthed times. The last excursion for it
that I can find is in the classic W C Fields film ""The Bank Dick""
of 1940, in which the word occurs in a variant form in the line:
""Surely, don't be a luddie-duddie, don't be a moon-calf, don't be a
jabbernow, you're not those, are you?"". Before that, it turns up in
one of the novels of Hall Caine in 1890, but even by then it seems
to have been rather rare.It's from the old French ""jobard"", from ""jobe"", silly. That word
was then added to ""noll"", the top or crown of the head, the noddle.
The first sense was of a block-like or stupid-looking head, but was
soon extended to refer to the quality of the mind within.
""Jobbernowlism"" is the condition or state of being a ""jobbernowl"",
or an act or remark that is especially stupid.Careful how you use it: the recipient might be a subscriber!

few days. On my way back, my eye was caught by this warning sign
posted above some steps at the local railway station:   Caution

4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. For my job I have to read American magazines concerning consumer
electronics, home systems, burglar alarms, etc. I very often come
across the expression ""bells and whistles"", which seem to relate to
equipment, accessories or features that are offered to the customer
as plusses but are not really indispensable for the device to work.
Is that right? And where does that funny phrase come from? [Herve
Castelain, France]Q. You're right about the meaning of this phrase, which refers to
gimmicks - non-essential but often engaging features added to a
piece of technical equipment or a computer program to make it seem
more superficially attractive without enhancing its main function.The phrase is actually quite modern and may be a product of the
American military. At least, one of its earliest appearances was in
an article in ""Atlantic"" in October 1982, which said it was
""Pentagon slang for extravagant frills"". There's some evidence that
the term has actually been around since the 1960s, but the early
evidence is sparse.Where it comes from is still a matter of learned debate. A literal
sense of the phrase appeared around the middle of the nineteenth
century, referring to streetcars, railways and steamships. Before
modern electronics, there were really only two ways to make a loud
warning noise - you either rang a bell or tooted a whistle. Steam
made the latter a real power in the land (anybody who has heard the
noisy out-of-tune calliope on the steamboat Natchez at New Orleans
will agree about its power, though less so about its glory). And at
one time ""clang, clang, clang went the trolley"" in large numbers of
American cities.At least some early US railroad locomotives had both bells and
whistles, as this extract from an article in ""Appleton's Journal""
of 1876 shows:  You look up at an angle of sixty degrees and see sweeping
  along the edge of a precipice, two-thirds up the rocky
  height, a train of red-and-yellow railway-cars, drawn by
  two wood-burning engines, the sound of whose bells and
  whistles seems like the small diversions of very little
  children, so diminished are they by the distance.Could it be that to have both bells and whistles was thought
excessive, a case of belt and braces, an unnecessary feature, a
frill?Possibly. But it's more probable the slang sense of the term comes
from that close musical relative of the calliope, the theatre
organ. Extraordinary instruments such as the Mighty Wurlitzer
augmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to
help the organist accompany silent films, among them car horns,
sirens, and bird whistles. These effects were called toys, and
organs often had ""toy counters"" with 20 or more noisemakers on
them, including various bells and whistles. In the 1950s, decades
after the talkies came in, but while theatre organs were still
common in big movie houses, these fun features must have been
considered no longer essential to the function of the organ but
mere fripperies, inessential add-ons.It's possible the slang sense grew out of that. It got taken up
especially by the computing industry, perhaps because opportunities
to add them are so great.                        -----------Q. The designation of ""robes"" for academic dress clearly comes from
its origin with the clergy in the Middle Ages. But what about
""mortarboards""? The best I could find was its origin in the 12th or
13th century clergy cap, but that was not square-shaped. Does
""mortarboard"" refer to the guilds or is its origin more ancient?A. The academic cap often called a ""mortarboard"" is quite ancient,
but that word for it only dates from the middle of the nineteenth
century (a less slangy way to identify it is to call it a
""square""). The literal mortar board is the wooden plate, usually
with a handle underneath, on which bricklayers carry small amounts
of mortar. A similar tool is used by plasterers, but they usually
call it a hawk.What seems to have happened is that the similarity in shape between
the brickie's board and the academic cap led some wag, probably at
Oxford University, to apply the name of the one to the other. Our
first recorded use is in a book of 1853-6, ""The Adventures of Mr.
Verdant Green, an Oxford Freshman"" by a clergyman named Edward
Bradley, who wrote under the pen name of Cuthbert Bede (the names
of the two patron saints of Durham, where he went to school).
Verdant Green is a sort of undergraduate Pickwick and the book
recounts his adventures. This magisterial reprimand by a don
appears after one such escapade: ""I will overlook your offence in
assuming that portion of the academical attire, to which you gave
the offensive epithet of 'mortar-board'; more especially, as you
acted at the suggestion and bidding of those who ought to have
known better"".After a slow start, the book became a huge success, selling more
than 200,000 copies in the next 20 years. Whether Mr Bradley
invented the slang term we may never know, but his book certainly
popularised it.                        -----------Q. I got into a discussion about ""chip off the old block"" with
friends, and we are wondering if it had to do with sculpting,
jewelry making, woodworking, or none of the above. What does this
term mean, and where did it come from? [Vijay Renganathan]A. The associations are with carpentry, and the block is definitely
made of wood.The first form of the expression was ""chip of the same block"",
meaning that a person or thing was made of the same stuff as
somebody or something else, so from the same source or parentage.
An early example is in a sermon by Dr Robert Sanderson (at one time
Bishop of Lincoln), dated 1637: ""Am not I a child of the same Adam
... a chip of the same block, with him?"".Later that century, another form is recorded ""a chip of the old
block"", which meant that somebody was the spitting image of his
father, or continued some family characteristic. At some point,
probably late in the nineteenth century, this was modified to ""a
chip off the old block"", which does nothing to change the sense,
but is the way it's now usually written or said.

831,"sum : quantification about four weeks ago , in linguist 8 . 948 , i asked a question on behalf of the basque language academy 's grammar commission about the standard or recommended scope of "" quantifier "" and "" quantification "" as grammatical terms , with special reference to the function of "" so many "" and "" so "" in sentences like : there were so many students that we needed a larger classroom . the students were so intelligent that we needed to get another teacher . i wished to know whether it is considered terminologically appropriate to say that not only "" many "" and "" so many "" but also "" very "" and "" so "" quantify , and thus that the function of all of these ( including what i call degree modifiers ) is quantification . better to contextualize the terminological problem that motivated the question in the first place and to help clarify the following report / discussion , let me suggest , ad hoc , calling the two positions contemplated the "" quantifiers versus degree modifiers "" position and the "" quantifiers subsuming degree modifiers "" position respectively ; or for short , the versus position and the subsuming position . it is also only honest for me to declare at this point that my personal position has always been and continues to be that of the versus view , although i tried to word the original question neutrally . at this point i perhaps ought to note that several respondents seem to prefer to treat "" so many ( students ) "" and "" so ( intelligent ) "" as merely various occurrences of a single item "" so "" rather than treating _ so many _ as an "" item "" to be discussed in its own right . i view this as a manifestation of linguistic anglocentrism : unlike english , in many languages "" so many "" is not expressed by the item equivalent to english "" so "" plus a quantifier equivalent to english "" many "" , and since i was not particularly asking about english in my question , i reject the assumption that the english lexical composition of "" so many "" is of crucial relevance to the issue i raised . thanks to the following who responded to my question : bruce d . despain , patricia galea , e . h . klein - v . d . laaken , jan k . lindstrom , p . l . peterson and marilyn n . silva . a summary of their answers and suggestions follows , with an interjection of my own personal opinion at times , identified by my initials ark . marilyn silva supports the versus position , stating that "" quantifiers determine noun phrases , not adjectives . "" for "" very "" and "" so "" she prefers the term "" intensifier "" to my proposed "" degree modifier "" . patricia galea expresses the same views . ( [ ark : ] since my original question was not about the latter terms , i shall refrain from defending my preference of "" degree modifier "" over "" intensifier "" in this context ; larry trask 's _ dictionary of grammatical terms in linguistics _ treats the two terms as interchangeble . ) marilyn silva also discussed what i called "" consecutive "" sentences , pointing out that the subordinate clauses in the two english examples cited above , "" . . . that we needed a larger classroom "" and "" . . . that we needed to get another teacher "" , are called "" adverbial clauses of extent "" in her treatment of english grammar , _ grammar in many voices _ ( ntc pub . group , 1995 ) . she considers that here "" it is the clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause "" . silva went on to point out that english clauses of extent can be licensed by a main clause containing _ so _ ( with or without _ many _ ) , as above , but also by one containing _ such _ , as in : george was such a gentleman that he never raised his voice . and draws our attention to the fact that _ such _ could hardly be called a quantifier . ( [ ark : ] this argument seems to be of general typological interest , independently of the fact that there is no real equivalent of this use of _ such _ in basque . ) in all these sentences with extent clauses , silva argues , "" it is the [ subordinate ] clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause . . . which merely licenses the subordinate clause . "" according to silva , then , _ so _ and _ such _ should not be lumped together with items like _ many _ or _ very _ in any case , in line with the view that they do not themselves quantify but merely license a subordinate clause which quantifies . looking beyond english , jan lindstrom pointed out that in swedish a single lexical item , _ mycket _ , functions both as a quantifier ( of nouns ) meaning "" much "" and as a degree modifier or intensifier of adjectives meaning "" very "" , providing the following examples : 1 ) da "" r fanns mycket folk . ' there was much people ' 2 ) hon a "" r mycket intelligent . ' she is very intelligent ' lindstrom does not seem to be defending a particular terminological usage in providing this observation , but merely wishes to offer useful information that may be of interest in the discussion . [ ark : ] it seems to me that while the interest of this sort of observation is undeniable , it does not obviate the need for a terminological distinction , nor does it justify the subsumes position , but rather illustrates the need for linguists to employ a clear meta-language to enable us to distinguish between items or uses even where , as here , their formal expressions overlap language-specifically . ( by the way , some other instances of the use of a single form for "" very "" and "" much "" include portuguese _ muito _ , catalan _ molt _ , and italian _ molto _ ; but i can think of many more languages that do not show this kind of overlap or homonymy . ) philip peterson wrote discussing in somewhat more abstract terms the actual semantics of terms like "" many "" and "" more "" , and referred me to his article "" complexly fractionated syllogistic quantifiers "" ( journal of philosophical logic , 1991 , 20 , 287-313 ) . bruce despain 's comments are oriented to language-specific issues of syntactic classification of quantifiers in english that are not likely to be relevant to a description of basque , for which reason i shall not report his suggestions here . henny klein brought to my attention the following bibliographical reference : gary , e . ( 1979 ) extent in english . a unified account of degree and quantity . phd thesis , university of california , los angeles . in summary , none of those who responded favoured the subsuming position according to which "" very "" and "" so "" can be referred to as quantifiers or their function as quantification ( unless that was what jan lindstrom wished to imply ; it is my understanding that it was not ) . four of the six answers do not actually lean one way or the other . the two answers that address my question directly and suggest an answer , those of silva and galea , both constitute votes for the versus position . eskerrik asko denoi ( many thanks to all ) alan r . king , ph . d . alanking @ bigfoot . com alternative email addresses : mccay @ redestb . es , a @ eirelink . com , 70244 . 1674 @ compuserve . com snail : orkolaga plaza 3 1a , 20800 zarautz , basque country , spain phone : + 34-43 - 134125 / fax : + 34-43 - 130396 visit my web page at - - > http : / / www . eirelink . com / alanking /",Safe Email

Date: 2002-10-08T01:21:33-06:00DeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because 
it makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, 
Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this 
in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) 
licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many 
ways encouraged. *Tools:*
1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)
1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)
1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 ""Jaguar"" *Process:*
1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for 
you.
2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to 
your hard drive. Ejct the DVD.
3. In DVD Player, select ""Open VIDEO_TS Folder..."" from the File menu. Use the 
dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I 
could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could 
share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or 
violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer 
users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. *Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, 
finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not 
sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, 
please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that 
Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.",Safe Email

Date: Not suppliedI just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This 
excerpt was rather amusing._It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better 
browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed 
browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser 
window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in 
Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called 
MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, 
Yecies, of Netscape, said, ""That's true, but the engineer who's working on it 
[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of 
fostering general browsing usability for Netscape."" 
_
Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by ""Netscape employee"" you really meant 
""Apple employee."" and by ""always done with the intention of fostering general 
browsing usability for Netscape"" you meant ""was done in a weekend for Mozilla 
because I thought MultiZilla was cool."" Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally 
downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I 
was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed 
browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed 
browser that embedded WinIE. MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 
prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was 
a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last 
context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been 
definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure 
capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that 
the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a 
weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that 
encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files 
would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the 
single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So 
much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was 
overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) 
Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 
browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still 
didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 
nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They 
continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity 
that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make 
of it.Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure 
Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it 
now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and 
twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say ""you 
should do this"" or ""you should do that"", they get completely ignored (or blown 
off), but when CNet says ""We didn't like this, or we didn't like that."", 
Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.[1] http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/10/browser_wars/

as a criminal, not celebrated in word and song.But you knew that.When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target
children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in

the CPU is executing it. I.E. there is more logic
executed (including NIC logic) when going down
to the metal than when using lo. So how much
logic is involved for each type of IPC (why
are you limiting yourself to sockets? there are
mutexes, shared mem, files, messages...). Anyway the
best IPC method to choose is dictated by the data
you want to communicate between the processes,
as the various IPC mechanisms are tuned for
various data types.IBM are running a series comparing doze and Linux IPC mechanisms.
The socket (which references the others at the bottom) is here:

873,"The material appended below comes from Martin Gardner's
book _Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science_ -- revised
and expanded edition published in 1957 by Dover Publications,
Inc. (New York City).Bill Bennetta
_________________________________________________""[M]ost pseudo-scientists have a number of characteristics in
common.        ""First and most important of these traits is that cranks work
in almost total isolation . . . in the sense of having no fruitful
contacts with fellow researchers. . . . The modern crank insists
that his isolation is not desired on his part.  It is due, he claims,
to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new
ideas. . . .        ""The modern pseudo-scientist . . . stands entirely outside
the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are
introduced and evaluated.  He works in isolation.  He does not
send his findings to the recognized journals, or if he does, they
are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases
are excellent.  In most cases, the crank is not well enough
informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance
to a significant study.  As a consequence, he finds himself
excluded the journals and societies, and almost universally
ignored by the competent workers in his field.  In fact, the
reputable scientist does not even know of the crank's
existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through
non-academic channels, or unless the scientist makes a hobby
of collecting crank literature.  The eccentric is forced, therefore,
to tread a lonely way.  He speaks before organizations he
himself has founded, contributes to journals he himself may
edit, and -- until recently -- publishes books only when he
or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed
privately.        ""A second characteristic of the pseudo scientist, which
greatly strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward
paranoia. . . .        ""There are five ways in which the sincere pseudo-
scientist's paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited.        ""(1) He considers himself a genius.        ""(2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, as
ignorant blockheads.  Everyone is out of step except himself.
Frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of
stupidity, dishonesty, or other base motives.  If they ignore
him, he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable.
If they retaliate in kind, this strengthens his delusion that he
is battling scoundrels. . . .        ""(3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated
against. . . .        ""(4) He has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the
greatest scientists and the best established theories.  When
Newton was the outstanding name in physics, eccentric works
in that science were violently anti Newton.  Today, with
Einstein the father symbol of authority, a crank theory of
physics is likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton. . . .        ""(5) He often has a tendency to write in a complex
jargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases he
himself has coined. . . .""

  | From: ""John P. Looney"" 
  |[ ... ]
  | That's something that POSIX would do - make every platform as
  | equally broken, rather than standing up and saying ""how about
  | we try & make everyone better"". eh?  POSIX doesn't ""do"" anything.  POSIX is a de jour
 specification for a voluntary minimal implementation to
 encourage software transportability.  no-one, absolutely
 no-one, has or ever had to implement POSIX or be restricted
 to POSIX.  commercial considerations et.al. may encourage
 some ""POSIX-compatibility"", but that's a freely-made choice. IMHO, the process's weakness is a general rule --- which
 has been ignored on occasion --- to only consider ""formal""
 submissions of ""proven"" technologies.  that translates into
 specifying more-or-less common parts of the existing *ix
 implementations which actively contribute to the process.
 most of the committees are loath to blue-sky, solicit
 proposals/research, or pick an uncommon or unsponsored
 implementation, even when manifestly superior.  (IMHO,
 this is why POSIX is *ix and not, e.g., Plan9 or Inferno.) OTOH, considering the motivating force behind the process,
 it can be argued the above ""weakness"" is a strength ....  | (why? Because in the real world, you can't. Somethings just suck) yep.  which is not to say POSIX ""sucks"" per se.  but the old
 pre-POSIX *ix world arguably did, at least in terms of ease
 of software porting.  one of *ix's claims to fame is it is
 perhaps the first system where one could seriously consider
 porting, more or less intact and with relative ease, software
 from one architecture+platform+vendor to a radically utterly
 different triple. however, as people discovered, there's a lot of difference
 between ""consider porting"" and ""actually porting"" --- and
 some problems were silly.  some were self-inflicted (e.g.,
 assuming byte-orientation or a particular endianness); but
 others were Frustrating ""system"" incompatibilities --- the
 motivating force that lead to /usr/group, XPG (X/Open), POSIX,
 Spec1170, Unix98, Common Unix, &tc.     Ã‚Â«The nice thing about standards is there's so many to

890,">See Jared Diamond's excellent ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" for the story.Yeah, I know the party line.  The evidence for it is extremely meagre.
New Worlders had two entire continents and tens of millions of people,
which is a plenty big enough reservoir for infectious diseases to thrive
in.  Their records show that they were plagued with them long before 1492.Take Ireland in the early 1800s.  Assume a population of circa 8
million.  Take Ireland around 1900.  Assume a population not much
above 3 million.  Ignore natural variations between mortality and
natality.  Omit emigration.  Observe the Great Famine in the middle.
Deduce that it killed 5 million (actually about 1).  Transpose to 16th
century Mexico.  Grossly inflate estimates of pre-contact population,
because nobody has a damn clue what it was anyway.  Underestimate
later population levels.  Deduce that 10's of millions died.  Lather,
rinse, repeat.R

			      June, 2002In this issue:* Progress of Senate anti-spam bill
* European Union bans spamIF YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GOT THIS MESSAGE: Please see the
""About This Message"" section at the end.- --------------------------------------------------------------* Progress of Senate anti-spam billOver a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
reported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further
action in the Senate.CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
more spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
with S.630: http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtmlWe're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
the entire Internet community can support.- --------------------------------------------------------------* European Union bans spamGLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTEMay 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
(CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
Europe into a virtual ""spam-free zone"" after the formal adoption of the
directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
have a preexisting business relationship.""This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,"" said EuroCAUCE
Chairman George Mills. ""We are extremely pleased that the European
Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added

privacy of Europeans.""While six European Union member countries had already formalized ""opt-in""
in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.""Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
of Internet users,"" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. ""This is
a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
advertising.""""This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the

I like this idea, but from my reading - part of my dissertation research -
on GAs (or, in this case, more precisely ""Evolutionary Programming"", since
the parameters are non-binary and the major operator is mutation, not
crossover), you do need to keep in mind that the more interactions there are
between different variables, the better-tweaked the GA/EA will need to be,
especially to avoid local optima (which may have been the problem with the
suspiciously-high ""anti-ratware"" USER_AGENT scores). From past results,
what's needed are one or more of the below:
        A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves,
           with variation on a per-original score basis; ideally, allow
           for having ""correlated"" mutations - in other words, have a
           mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at
           once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly
           in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the
           ""Evolutionary Strategies"" of Schwefel;
        B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how
           well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a
           fifth of the new ""individuals"" are doing about as well as, or
           better than, the parental generation, then mutate more
           parameters; if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well
           as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate less
           parameters.        -Allen------- You are receiving this mail because: -------

' ' investors have questioned enron ' s financial reporting in the past year , especially after jeffrey skilling ' s resignation as ceo in august . skilling , who helped lay transform enron from a gas - pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading , said he left for personal reasons . investors said they weren ' t confident enron was detailing all its problems . failed businesses the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses , which total $ 1 . 11 a share , are equal to 70 percent of enron ' s $ 1 . 45 billion in profits over the past four quarters . included were $ 544 million for losses on investments in new power co . , a venture formed with aol time warner inc . and international business machines corp . new power competes for energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and gas suppliers as they do long - distance phone companies . the $ 544 million also includes losses from the enron unit that trades space , known as bandwidth , on fiber - optic networks , as well as for the ` ` early termination of certain structured finance arrangements ' ' with an undisclosed ` ` entity . ' ' enron wouldn ' t be more specific . enron said restructuring the fiber - optic unit would cost another $ 180 million , including severance pay to 500 fired workers . the business collapsed this year along with the fortunes of the dot - com companies that were expected to be some off its biggest customers . the declining value of assets owned by azurix corp . , its water and sewage treatment business , will cost $ 287 million , enron said . enron might take a first - quarter ` ` adjustment ' ' of less than $ 200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill , lay said in an interview . ` ` if we thought there were any other significant concerns , we would have taken care of them today , ' ' lay said . excluding losses minus the losses , enron would have earned $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , up 35 percent from the year - earlier period . that matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent for the past year . its wholesale services business , which includes energy trading , had income before interest , minority interests and taxes of $ 754 million , up 28 percent from a year earlier . shares of enron rose 67 cents to $ 33 . 84 . earlier , the stock had risen as much as 5 . 2 percent to $ 34 . 90 . ` ` there ' s a sigh of relief that enron ' s core businesses , its energy merchant businesses , are ok , ' ' said roger hamilton , who helps manage john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares . enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for the full year and $ 2 . 15 in 2002 . ` ridiculous investments ' at one time , enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that contributed to the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses . enron spent $ 2 . 8 billion in 1998 for the u . k . ' s wessex water , from which azurix emerged . enron sold shares to the public in 1999 , and then bought back the company this year after azurix failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning large projects . in august , enron agreed to sell azurix ' s north american business to american water works inc . for $ 150 million . in february 2000 , lay said trading bandwidth could become the company ' s fastest - growing business . in the latest quarter , the bandwidth unit ' s loss before interest , minority interests and taxes widened to $ 80 million from $ 20 million a year earlier . revenue plunged to $ 4 million from $ 162 million . ` ` you can make the case that jeff skilling leaving was for the best , ' ' john hancock ' s hamilton said . ` ` under him , they built the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous investments . ' ' while admitting its poor choices , enron also supplied more information this quarter about how it makes money . the company gave results of individual commodity - trading desks , including coal , forest products and steel . ` ` i liked that they broke out the different commodities , ' ' hamilton said . ` ` i think lay has gotten the message loud and clear , and that the effort is there .

904,"My only joke, thanks to a professor at the University of Manitoba, circa 
1997. Set in the old west.A cowboy is riding along on his favorite horse when he's suddenly 
surrounded and taken prison by a band of roaming Indians. The indians 
take the cowboy and his horse and tell him the traditional way that the 
tribe deals with their victims:
Each day for the next 3 days, you get a wish. If its in our power to 
grant it to you, we will. After the 3rd wish is done, you die a horrible 
slow death. Time for your first wish.The cowboy thinks a bit, and says ""I want to talk to my horse."" So the 
indians bring the horse over, the cowboy whispers in his ears, and the 
horse runs off. A little while later the horse comes back with a 
beautiful blond naked woman. The cowboy and the woman go in the tent, 
appropriate noises are heard, and then the horse takes the woman away.The next day, time for the wish comes, and the Indians, amazed at 
yesterday's performance, all gather round. The cowboy says ""I want to 
talk to my horse"". So the horse is brought over, the cowboy whispers in 
its ears, and the horse takes off. A little while later the horse comes 
back, with a beautiful brunette, naked, same routine as before, cowboy 
and the women go in the tent, ..., etc.On the third and final day, the indians are totally amazed, and are 
eager to hear what the cowboy's wish will be. So they all gather round, 
and the cowboy again says ""I want to talk to my horse."" The horse is 
brought over, and this time the cowboy grabs the horse by the head, 
stares right at him, and says -- ""Read my lips -- Posse! Posse!""

Falling asleep at the wheel is no laughing matter. Still, it kinda
happened with yesterday's
tip. I forgot to mention that the String value's label
is ""Logging"" (sans quotes). That was almost like a cliffhanger,
eh? The oversight was totally my fault. I've been thinking about
asking Gretchen and Brian to help with future reviews. Don't be
surprised if that happens soon. I'm sure you'd welcome a female
perspective on this stuff, right? She helped one of our landlords
pick a paint color for the ""office"" wall this evening. Does that
qualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the
Internet? You betcha. Let's see how she does with the drapes and
rugs. I have a feeling I'll be the one tweaking furniture layout.
Shouldn't be too much of an issue - yet. I wonder if Ikea has an
affiliate program?I've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but
did you know that it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If
you send an HTML message to someone who has a yahoo.com account,
something may get lost in the translation. Try sending this
sentence: ""My medieval mocha has an expression to evaluate.""
Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results will
surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any
scripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit
Marion Schroll for making me aware of the ""problem."" It's kinda
funny, in a weird sort of way. Not that I would want anything I
send changed in any way, shape, or form. It begs the question:
what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give them a bit, and
they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's throw
away.I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: ""What is
this crazy business with the broadband metering? What they
advertise doesn't seem to be what you get. Now that I'm forking
out $60 per month for a supposed metered rate of 640 down / 320
up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not sure what
I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure
if I'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me
out here? I'm feeling lied to; why can't I download 'til my 40 gig
is full? That is what they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT
I was paying for. I want consistent speed - is this too much to
ask?"" It's not too much to ask the question, but it's probably too
much to get the answer. I'm facing the same dilemma right now,
even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my area.
Expect more and more ""filters"" to be put in place as time marches
on. Watch those EULAs, folks.See You in August,Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Chris PirilloÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and uploading it to their website. As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories.
Web Calendar [25k] W2k/XP FREEhttp://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/WebCalendar.htm{Web page reminder} Surfing the web as much as I do, I'll occasionally run into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an ""Under Construction"" banner. I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning, or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week. Now, I will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of ""Lord of the Rings""...Recommend It!

CollegeBAR v8.0 [5.9M] W9x/2k/XP US$20
    Unearthed by Shawn Verrallhttp://www.pracx.com/collegebar.asp
 
{Mix your own drinks} When I was in college, my room used to be known as ""The Bar."" It may have had something do with my L-shaped desk that resembled a bar, and the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to be a bottle-flipping bartender. I never achieved my goal of being the world's best geek bartender, but maybe with College Bar I could have. College Bar contains recipes for over 11,600 drinks. With an online update feature, you can download new drinks as they become available... or you can add your own creative concoctions to the database! College Bar also has a calculator to determine someone's blood alcohol level... drink responsibly, folks. As an added bonus, you can load some of your favorite party pictures into the program and you'll see a slide show of those pictures - a great way to remember the good times... unless you don't remember experiencing them in the first place, that is.

Ã‚Â GnomeTIPI am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here... just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.

949,"> A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human

an imperfect world.>  The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. It does,

practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in 
Amman. And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and 
taking share from every other government broadcaster.It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term 
as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly 
centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re: 
ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic 
platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared 
they might.As you read, replace ""United States"" with ""Roman Empire"" and it may make 
as much sense, in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be 
about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President 
might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to 
our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations 
overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on 
how engaged we are in the world around us.Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the 
globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research

September 20, 2002Full Text: Bush's National Security StrategyFollowing is the full text of President Bush's new national security 
strategy. The document, entitled ""The National Security Strategy of the 
United States,"" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of 
the Administration's policy.INTRODUCTIONTHE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and 
totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of 
freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, 
democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only 
nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and 
guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the 
potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People 
everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; 
worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own 
property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom 
are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of 
protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of 
freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military 
strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our 
heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for 
unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that 
favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies 
can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and 
economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the 
world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace 
against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace 
by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the 
peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental 
commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed 
dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great 
industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of 
individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less 
than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to 
penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies 
against us.To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- 
from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and 
cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global 
reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help 
nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will 
hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the 
allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and 
countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop 
new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every 
turn.The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism 
and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking 
weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing 
so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to 
succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other 
means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, 
contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous 
technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America 
will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We 
cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must 
be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence 
and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who 
saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have 
entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic 
opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community 
has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 
seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace 
instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers 
find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist 
violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common 
interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by 
common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching 
for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese 
leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of 
national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political 
freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage 
the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, 
because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and 
international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great 
powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, 
trade, and cultural advancement.Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend 
the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring 
the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to 
every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us 
that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our 
national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people 
into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and 
corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and 
drug cartels within their borders.The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a 
better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free 
trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies 
out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual 
nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to 
build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. 
The United States will deliver greater development assistance through 
the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, 
invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also 
continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of 
AIDS and other infectious diseases.In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is 
guided by the conviction that all nations have important 
responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. 
Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the 
spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international 
aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For 
freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, 
better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply 
the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed 
to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade 
Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as 
other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment 
these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations 
are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to 
rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of 
every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has 
been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the 
clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and 
it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity 
holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all 
these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in 
this great mission.I. Overview of America's International Strategy
""Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We 
fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors 
liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists 
and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among 
the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and 
open societies on every continent.""
President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength 
and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of 
liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with 
unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great 
strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that 
favors freedom.For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great 
struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and 
equality.That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and 
race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and 
discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we 
are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by 
catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must 
defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to 
translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, 
and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a 
distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our 
values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help 
make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to 
progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations 
with other states, and respect for human dignity.And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.To achieve these goals, the United States will:*	champion aspirations for human dignity;*	strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent 
attacks against us and our friends;*	work with others to defuse regional conflicts;*	prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our 
friends, with weapons of mass destruction;*	ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and 
free trade;*	expand the circle of development by opening societies and building 
the infrastructure of democracy;*	develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of 
global power; and*	transform America's national security institutions to meet the 
challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.
II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity
""Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the 
language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require 
different methods, but not different moralities.""President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we 
stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because 
these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation 
owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and 
mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live 
free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be 
oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of 
the secret police.America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human 
dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; 
free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; 
religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served 
us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, 
facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these 
core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not 
been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and 
aspirations of their people.Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in 
our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of 
Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a 
stronger, but is a freer and more just society.Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And 
when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central 
and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When 
we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in 
the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin 
America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can 
evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all 
cherish.Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, 
the national security strategy of the United States must start from 
these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international 
cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation 
of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international 
bodies.We will:*	speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of 
human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to 
advance freedom;*	use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who 
struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward 
democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;*	make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key 
themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation 
from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights 
to move toward a better future; and*	take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience 
and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.
We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist 
it.III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent 
Attacks Against Us and Our Friends
""Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have 
the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already 
clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been 
waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is 
peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on 
the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of 
our choosing.""President Bush
Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)
September 14, 2001The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of 
global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or 
religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, 
politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a 
lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed 
within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United 
States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals 
with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who 
knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in 
our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly 
elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come 
through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some 
unseen.Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, 
and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to 
achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition 
forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not 
only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of 
trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South 
America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist 
organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, 
control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will 
have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a 
coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional 
campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure 
the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial 
tools necessary to finish the task.The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the 
financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of 
funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who 
support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial 
system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, 
and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative 
financial networks.However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the 
cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we 
seek.We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:*	direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and 
international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist 
organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of 
terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction 
(WMD) or their precursors;*	defending the United States, the American people, and our interests 
at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it 
reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to 
enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate 
to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by 
acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing 
harm against our people and our country; and*	denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists 
by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign 
responsibilities.
We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international 
terrorism. This includes:*	using the full influence of the United States, and working closely 
with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are 
illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as 
slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government 
can condone or support and all must oppose;*	supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim 
world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote 
terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;*	diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by 
enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources 
on areas most at risk; and*	using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of 
information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of 
those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.
While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also 
strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter 
attack.This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization 
since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council 
and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland 
Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental 
reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland 
encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public 
and the private sector.This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, 
emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with 
terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened 
to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and 
mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop 
terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism 
in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. 
Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations 
and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where 
governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we 
will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and 
our allies can provide.As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work 
with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as 
non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the 
humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to 
rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, 
threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terroristsIn the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are 
ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom 
and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this 
conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, 
productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in 
ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts
""We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. 
The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements 
look so small.""President Bush
Berlin, Germany
May 23, 2002Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional 
disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In 
an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our 
alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create 
horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states 
falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to 
alleviate suffering and restore stability.No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- 
direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, 
and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States 
will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:*	The United States should invest time and resources into building 
international relationships and institutions that can help manage local 
crises when they emerge.*	The United States should be realistic about its ability to help 
those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when 
people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.
Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will 
apply these principles:The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of 
human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state 
of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance 
to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace 
for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed 
to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in 
peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a 
government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and 
counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all 
parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and 
comprehensive settlement to the conflict.The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank 
stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic 
development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to 
establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If 
Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront 
corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support 
for the creation of a Palestinian state.Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. 
Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the 
United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete 
steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. 
As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw 
fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent 
with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement 
activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, 
freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians 
to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial 
role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and 
Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India 
and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested 
time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and 
Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a 
constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With 
Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's 
choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more 
open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to 
become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century 
and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our 
involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in 
bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan 
that can help defuse military confrontation.Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and 
respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting 
the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to 
employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its 
neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by 
Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with 
countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, 
Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic 
hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, 
opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as 
the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States 
(OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of 
the entire hemisphere.Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising 
from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict 
and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and 
security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active 
strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce 
their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of 
drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs 
in our own country.In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist 
groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking 
activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are 
working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat 
illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective 
sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic 
security to the Colombian people.In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, 
and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United 
States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- 
combating global terror. American interests and American principles, 
therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an 
African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. 
Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's 
fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous 
borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence
